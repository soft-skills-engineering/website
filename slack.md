Welcome to the Soft Skills Engineering Slack team! We're excited to have you join this community interested in the non-technical parts of the technical field of software. These guidelines will help keep the environment safe, welcoming, and friendly.

## Guidelines
1. Hop in to #intros and introduce yourself. Help us get to know you!
2. Fill out your profile. Make yourself a human.
3. Read the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).
4. Remmeber that everyone is welcome to contribute regardless of experience level or background. If you just want to hang back and lurk, that’s cool too.
5. This Slack is not a place for commercial activity (e.g. recruiting, or marketing your product/conference) except in channels dedicated to that purpose (e.g. #jobs, #consulting-gigs, #conferences, or #services) and never in an unsolicited direct message. If you see commercial behavior going down, direct message @jamison and I’ll fix it.
6. Really, read the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).

We're so glad you're joining us. See you on Slack!
