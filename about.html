Being a great engineer takes much more than writing code. Soft Skills Engineering is a weekly advice podcast for

hosts, <a href="https://twitter.com/jamison_dance">Jamison Dance</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/djsmith42">Dave Smith</a>,
are here to make you laugh and make you wise as they answer your questions on the air each week.
