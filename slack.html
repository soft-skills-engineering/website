    <p class="lead">Welcome to the Soft Skills Engineering Slack!</p>
    <p>We're excited to have you join this community interested in the non-technical parts of the technical field of software. These guidelines will help keep the environment safe, welcoming, and friendly.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-2">Guidelines</h3>
    <ul class="num-list">
      <li>Hop in to #intros and introduce yourself. Help us get to know you!</li>
      <li>Fill out your profile. Make yourself a human.</li>
      <li>Read the <a href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
      <li>Remember that everyone is welcome to contribute regardless of experience level or background. If you just want to hang back and lurk, that’s cool too.</li>
      <li>This Slack is not a place for commercial activity (e.g. recruiting, or marketing your product/conference) except in channels dedicated to that purpose (e.g. #jobs, #consulting-gigs, #conferences, or #services) and never in an unsolicited direct message. If you see commercial behavior going down, direct message @jamison and I’ll fix it.</li>
      <li>Really, read the <a href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a href>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We're so glad you're joining us. See you on Slack!</p>

    <p><small>Thanks to the Rands in Repose <a href="https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/">Slack guidelines</a> which influenced this document.</small></p>
