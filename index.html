    Facing a 9 hour drive, I grabbed a bunch of podcasts to listen to. I don't even know what the other ones are.
    Seriously, this podcast is full of massively helpful and relevant content from two people who are experienced, funny, and insightful.

  <blockquote class="testimonial">
    I owe you a lot, listening to Soft Skills has completely shifted my thoughts on what it means to be an engineer.
    It’s probably one of the more useful things I’ve gained during my time at Amazon. I kind of brushed this stuff off, considering some of it
    politics, and the rest unimportant, but boy was I wrong. It definitely helped me grow, and I’m totally indebted to you for that.
