    Facing a 9 hour drive, I grabbed a bunch of podcasts to listen to. I don't even know what the other ones are.
    Seriously, this podcast is full of massively helpful and relevant content from two people who are experienced, funny, and insightful.

  <blockquote class="testimonial">
    Listening to Soft Skills Engineering has completely shifted my thoughts on what it means to be an engineer.
    It’s probably one of the more useful things I’ve gained during my time at Amazon.
    It definitely helped me grow, and I’m totally indebted to you for that.
