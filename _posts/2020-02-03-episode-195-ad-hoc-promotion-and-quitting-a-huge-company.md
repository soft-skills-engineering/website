In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I’ve had the role of tech lead informally for the past two years at a fast-growing tech startup. We were a team of 6 developers, and now we are 16. Recently, we had a department meeting in which the Software Development VP communicated that we have 3 teams and I was the tech lead of two of them. I was surprised. He hasn’t mentioned his decision of splitting the teams nor that I’ve been officially promoted to tech lead. I was expecting a one-on-one where he would “pop the question”: Will you be my tech lead?
   
   I asked him privately if that meant I would be officially promoted and would have my title changed. He said that he was going to have this conversation with the HR Manager and would get back to me, but potentially.
   
   He doesn't spend time on one-on-ones, nor is he very good at managing people although he’s good technically. How weird is this situation? A manager tells his team that they now have a tech lead along some org changes. I haven’t been informed, haven’t had my title changed yet, and haven’t been offered a raise yet.


2. Hi! I love your show and have been listening to it almost since day one. I was an engineer for about 10 years, and I've been a manager for about 1 year, and I love my team. They're high performers, we have a high level of trust. I also like my boss! But the larger org has some issues, and in time-honored Soft Skills Engineering tradition, I plan to quit. I would like to stay in management. So I have these questions:
   
   1) My employer is a very large public company. How much should I care about negative headlines and Wall Street's opinion?
   
   2) How long should I stay in my role as a manager before looking for a new job?
   
   3) How do I message this to my team when I leave?
