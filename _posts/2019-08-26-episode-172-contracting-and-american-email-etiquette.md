In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I'm a Full Stack Developer. I feel undervalued at my current job and I am looking at other opportunities. Many recruiters approach me on LinkedIn with contract-to-hire positions. Usually this means the benefits are not as good as direct hire positions and that the company can just dispose of me when the contract is done (after 6 or 12 months, generally). Salaries seem to be higher when contracting, though.
   Have you ever worked as a contractor for a large company? Would you recommend it? How likely is it that companies use this type of employment as a way to temporarily hire somebody for a specific project and then get rid of them once it's done? What signs should I look for to avoid such companies? Does contracting actually make a difference? I live in Oregon, where employment is at-will anyway, so I can get fired at any time without any warning.


2. Hello, I'm a mechanical engineer from Brazil. I really love your podcast. As a mechanical engineer I don't develop software but I believe the soft skills are important to everyone.
   I work in an American multinational company and I often talk or send e-mails to the engineers there. However, our culture is different so I don't know how to behave or how straightforward, informal or political I must be. I'm always afraid of offending someone. What kind of things I never should say or do when dealing with Americans? We Brazilians become friendly and intimate very fast. Do you guys notice these kind of different behavior from different cultures?
