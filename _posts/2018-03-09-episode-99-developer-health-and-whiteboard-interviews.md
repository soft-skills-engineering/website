[Dave](https://twitter.com/djsmith42) and [Jamison](https://twitter.com/jergason) answer these questions:

1. Do you have any recommendations for maintaining physical health in a software developer role? For example, strategies to maintain good posture, reduce eye strain, etc.
2. Is the practice of asking interviewing developers to regurgitate 20 year old algorithms on a whiteboard a recent trend or is this something new? Can you make sense of this madness?

[This](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-sitting-may-be-hazardous-to-your-health) is a pretty good summary of some of the health effects of sitting.

[Here](https://twitter.com/threepointone/status/942872860779057153) is the tweet Jamison talked about.
