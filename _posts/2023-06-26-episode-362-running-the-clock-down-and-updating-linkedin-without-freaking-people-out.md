In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Greetings from Germany! My job is creating a customized Windows installation image with PowerShell & C#.  It takes about 2 hours to build and test an image. Sometimes I have to wait until the end to see if a change did actually work or not. During that time I usually browse the web / watch Youtube / read a book. This makes me feel like an impostor, because I am maybe working 10-25% of the time. Since Iâ€™ve only been with this company 1 year, 6 months, I don't really have any other things to do in that time. Most of my colleagues have been with the company for upwards of 10 years and work in multiple projects at the same time, so they don't have this issue.
   
   On the one hand, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong. On the other hand, it feels like fraud. Should I feel guilt and if so, what should I do about this situation?

2. I am a software engineer at a large tech company in middle America. I like my job, like my leadership, and am fairly compensated for my work. In fact, Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m about to be moved up a level! When (if ðŸ˜…) I get the new job title, I believe the responsible thing to do is to update my resume and LinkedIn account so that if (when ðŸ˜³) my management or role changes for the worse, I can take your advice and find a new job.
   
   However, I havenâ€™t updated my LinkedIn profile since I graduated college. How can I update my LinkedIn without worrying or upsetting anyone? To complicate matters, my entire team moved on to better things in the last six months, so suspicions are already high.
