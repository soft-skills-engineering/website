This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. When should asking a developer pal for help go from something that is free because you're pals to something you should compensate them for in some way?
2. I've never worked with recruiters before. I've always found jobs from friends and other connections. Is working with recruiters worth it? What should I watch out for?

I finally found the creepy [Jack and the Beanstalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqEVYbPw9lI) video! It is still horrifying.
