This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. How do I keep up with new tech as a team lead?
2. I manage a team. A manager from a different team wants me to run everything I do in my team by him. What do I do?

Jamison mentions [this](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/) by Charity Majors on the pendulum between technical and people leadership.

Jamison also mentions [this](https://hbr.org/2016/12/if-your-boss-could-do-your-job-youre-more-likely-to-be-happy-at-work) HBR article on employee happiness.
