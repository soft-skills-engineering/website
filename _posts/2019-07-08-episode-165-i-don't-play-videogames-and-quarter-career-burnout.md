In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I recently joined a startup. After joining I realized most of the engineers are gamers. They play games during the lunch hour, and if we end up having lunch together, everyone is talking about the game that they are playing or some news in the gaming circle.
   
   As a non-gamer and introvert, I find it different to join in their conversation. How can I join in, or bring the talk back to something else?


2. I've been working as an Android Engineer for 7 years from the beginning of my career. I loved my profession but things started to go not so well with reaching of the senior level.
   
   Coding tasks became boring because I knew how to solve them before starting. Most of the time I was helping less senior engineers but it didn't give me satisfaction.
   
   I tried to solve the problem by quitting my job. I joined a company with a team of only senior engineers hoping that it meant more challenging tasks.
   
   Things did not improve. Tasks are still boring and I don't learn anything new from my colleagues because they are around the same tech level as me.
   
   I don't think I'm burned out because I still enjoy programming when I need to use my brain for solving a problem.
   
   I don't want to move to management because I like coding more than people.
   
   I don't want to switch to another tech stack because it means a pay cut and I think that I'll get bored again in a year or so.
   
   Is it some kind of quarter-career crisis? Is there a way to be an expert at the field and still like your job?
