In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Listener Olexander asks,
   
   I was a tech lead on some relatively known project since the beginning for more than a year. I made several trade-offs with technologies and wrong decisions. I participate in some generic Slack organisations and met several users of my product. I haven't told them that I was connected to implementing the project but sometimes shared some insights on how the product is tested and asked opinions about some of features of the product in comparison to the competitors. Now there is a person who continuously critiques the product. Sometimes the criticism is valid but sometimes is's just a rant. How can I influence that person without blowing my cover?

2. Listener Kieran asks,
   
   Hi guys! Loving the podcast from down under. I'm working part time as a dev while I complete my software engineering degree. It's been fun, but there are almost no processes in place for development and not many other devs seem to care about improvement.
   
   Although I am the most inexperienced here I feel some of the devs do not care about the quality of the work as I often have to refactor some of their code due to it being buggy, slow and undocumented (still using var in javascript).
   
   I've talked to management about improving our standards. However, they brushed me off saying yeah some of the developers are stubborn. They are not brushing me off because I lack technicality as Ive been given an end user app as a solo project. How should I go about encouraging the team to improve our processes?
