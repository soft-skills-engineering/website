In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Liam asks,
   
   I was the second hire in my team and worked with one lead engineer who created the entire codebase from scratch. This engineer's code was functional but not well architected and has many inconsistencies. They have since left the company and replaced with two new senior developers who are a lot stronger technically.
   
   We recognize issues with the current codebase but we're finding it hard to make decisions on the best way of solving things. We're all at the same seniority level and the managers above us do not have hands-on experience with our codebase or tech stack.
   
   Because we're at the same seniority level I don't want to start acting beyond my job title and make all the architectural decisions, but at the same time I don't want to be a pushover.
   
   How should decisions be made in a team with a flat structure and no defined leader?

2. My previous manager quit the company last year and we've been assigned a new one. While the previous manager knew technical side of the project really well, the new one seems to be clueless. He is not even showing any interest in learning about what we do. He is a good people manager, but lack of context makes him really bad project manager. What should I do? Should I talk to him to convince him to learn more or maybe it is normal and we were just really lucky with the previous manager?
