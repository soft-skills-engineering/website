In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I work at a large public company. Two years ago, they hired a new CEO who immediately started a development center in a different country. Much of the knowledge transfer is complete and this new team outnumbers us by 3 to 1. It feels that we have lost much of our influence. They turn out decent work and cost less than 1/10th to employ. I am ramping up a job search but in the mean time what steps can we take to keep influence and control? Also, is this the future for the industry in the US?


2. Hi Jamison and Dave.
   Your voices have been bringing sanity into my head for the last 2 years.
   I'd like to get your thoughts about something that's driving me a little crazy.
   I work for a company based in Europe, and work in the Asian office. The Asian office, and only the Asian office, has a fixed time schedule. To overlap with Europe, the Asian team has to be at the office from 2PM to 11PM. However, the European team comes in at 10AM and leaves at 7PM.
   When our team mates in Europe decide to do overtime, we have to stay later to work with them, often very late in the night but I tolerate it because I love software development. However, whenever we have company "fun" events, the Asian managers schedule it in the morning so that our regular work schedule won't be consumed. So we'll do badminton or wall-climbing from 9AM to 12 and then have to do the 2PM to 11PM shift. This is very tiring. The events usually happen every two weeks, but our schedule makes me dread them. It's even worse if the "fun" events happen on the same day as the overtime. At the end of work, I feel like a zombie! Is this reasonable?
