In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Listener Brad asks,
   
   I am currently a Senior Engineer with a small software company. I have been developing software for more than 20 years. We were recently acquired by another mid sized company. Since the acquisition, things have been going downhill. It feels like they’re trying to nickel and dime their employees to death.
   
   They moved from a bi-monthly to bi- weekly pay, from accrued PTO to Flex PTO, they sat on merit raises for over 2 months , and have paused all promotions unless you are getting a promotion to management. We have a number of engineers who are deserving, but broaching the subject with HR results in excuses, pushback or silence.
   
   I have about a year and a half to be in a position to retire but I love what I do and plan to continue for many more years in the right environment. I'm really on the fence as to whether I quit for a new role or hope that they somehow become more efficient. I've been doing this long enough to know they will probably not change. So would you quit?

2. Hello Dave and Jamison,
   
   
   My name is Angelo, and I'm writing to you from Italy. I've been enjoying your podcast for quite some time.
   
   I'm reaching out because I've been working for four years at a small company with 11 people in the cultural heritage sector. Although the company produces software, there are only 2 programmers (myself included), while the rest are roles like graphic designers, art historians, and archaeologists.
   
   It's a rather unique company in its field, and for that reason, I'm happy to work there, also because I have many responsibilities related to the company's performance, probably more than I would have in a multinational corporation.
   
   However, there's a catch. The fact that there are only two programmers, and in this case, I am the more experienced one, often makes me feel that I don't have the opportunity to interact with more experienced individuals, and this might hinder my growth as a professional as opposed to being in a team with more programmers.
   
   My question is: what can I do to compensate for the lack of work interactions with other developers and to keep myself updated?
   
   I've always read that the best growth happens in a company where you're surrounded by more experienced people, but in this particular case, I find myself in the opposite situation.
   
   I participate in Telegram groups and often read software development books to stay updated, but it's also true that the hours outside of work are meant for rest and leisure, so they only go so far. How can I keep pace with those working in larger teams on bigger projects? I don't intend to change companies at the moment.
   
   Warm regards from Italy,
   Sinhuè
