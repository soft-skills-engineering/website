In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. I'm feeling bored and disengaged with my job lately, but I'm pretty sure it's one of the best jobs I can find: my manager and teammate are great, my compensation is very high for my area, worklife balance/benefits etc are excellent, and the mission and product the company make are awesome and help the world! On top of all that I think the work is technically interesting! But still I'm bored and disengaged :(
   
   I can't tell if I'm just burned out from the pandemic and this is how it's manifesting, or if I just have a serious case of "the grass is always greener" and now that I've been on this team for 2 years I'm ready just for a change of scenery. I want to fall back in love with this job, but how can I do that? Do you have any advice? Changing teams isn't a great fit as this is a small office for the company in a ""satellite"" site, with only one other team that I'm not super interested in.
   
   I could of course take the patented advice and find a new job that might be equally great, but what else can I do?


2. Listener Very Verbose asks,
   
   Love the show! I'm rapidly working my way through the backlog and dread the day that I reach the end and have to wait a whole week for the next one! :)
   
   Whenever I write a message to a coworker I tend to start with a huge wall of text, then revise it down to something smaller and hit send. I do this with emails, slack messages, code review feedback, you name it. Even this question I've re-written a few times!
   
   I feel like I'm over-thinking things, and trying to make sure there is no misunderstanding in what I've written. For example, a relatively small piece of feedback for a code review might be re-written many times, because I'm concerned that I will come across as overly negative or condescending if I just send through my first draft.
   
   Often, the feedback is positive and they agree with the points that I've raised. But they're only seeing 2 points, when I probably started with 10 and deleted 8 of them that I later deemed to be 'too nitpicky' before sending it through!
   
   Naturally, all of this takes time and I'm often wasting more than 20 mins, only to end up sending 2-3 sentences at the end of it. Do you have any tips for helping me get to the point, so that I can be more productive and move on with other work? Do I just need to care less about what they think of me? Should I just skim over the code, say "LGTM", and suppress the fear that I may have just approved a critical bug to go to production?
   
   Appreciate any advice you can give. Unfortunately, I don't think inventing a time machine to go back 18 minutes after spending 20 minutes writing a message is a reasonable option :) It would take me several decades to be happy with the time machine before I turn it on!
