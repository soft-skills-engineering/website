In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I recently joined a new company that pays me much better and has much better engineering practices than my previous job.
   
   I referred a great engineer who was hired on a different team. Then, _another_ engineer from my old job applied for MY team and is currently being interviewed for the role.
   
   This engineer is one of the reasons I left my former company! They have an impressive resume and interview well, but are unable to complete even the most basic tasks and have no interest in improving their skills. They asked me to put in a good word with my tech lead, but if anything, I want to encourage my tech lead NOT to hire them. I'm not a part of the interviewing process but I feel an obligation to let my tech lead know just how bad this developer is. Help?

2. Thanks for thinking I'm neat! I think you are pretty neat too!
   
   In my most recent 121, my manager asked me to give some feedback on another colleague on whether I thought they would make a good Engineering Manager. My genuine thoughts about my colleague are that they're pretty good technically, they have good communication skills, are friendly, and just generally a good team player. Outside of work, we're pretty good friends and so I really want to see them succeed. However, I can't shake the feeling that they wouldn't necessarily be a good Engineering Manager and I can't figure out why. What are some other (not so obvious) qualities that you think are important for EMs, since on paper, I would think they tick a lot of the boxes.
