In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Listener Albert Camus asks,
   
   Hello Team. I am a long time listener of the show, and I really enjoy it.
   I'm a senior engineer and want to get to the next level in my career. I talked to my manager about this. I told them I preferred the technical side and staff engineer was the next level up. He responded positively, although he didn't give me a timeline, not even a vague estimate.
   In a subsequent meeting they told me it wasn't a linear progression at the company and there's quite an overlap in the salary range between senior and staff engineer. I was also told that the company only had a few staff level engineers and they were considered experts at a particular sub-section of a technology.
   This makes me feel like I am being stalled. I have seen this a few years ago, at a previous workplace, where I tried for a promotion, and the manager at that place kept giving excuses to buy time. I am afraid that could be the case here as well.
   I am technically strong and have good soft-skills. I have designed, developed  and documented multiple features for the company. Whenever there's a complex bug, the product manager always turns towards me for help. I also handle inter-team discussions at times, always a part of the interview panel while hiring new team members and at most times the only person representing my team from the tech perspective during alignment meetings with the sales and marketing teams. I could also say with confidence that I bring more value to the table and have data to back it up.
   But I am not sure how I could use all this information without seeming desperate, to really push for that promotion and a raise. I could quit and get a new job, most probably with a promotion, but I have put in a lot of effort here and I intend to stay at the current company for at least the next couple of years to reap the rewards. What can I do to get that promotion in the coming year?

2. We know that the salary is high in our area, and I don't need all this money. So, what is your opinion on part time job and how can I get one?
   
   I'm a senior frontend with more than 15 years of experience and just want to live a little.
