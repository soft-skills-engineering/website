In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I'm working for minimum wage as a full Systems Administrator at a State University while I'm taking classes. I really like working here, but I need to make at LEAST 40K /year to justify this level of effort for much longer. I just got offered a job two hours away for 80 - 100K as a System Administrator at a smallish ISP. The same day my boss told me he got approval to hire me on at 45K in 3 - 4 months.
   
   If I wait and stay I'm not making what I feel I'm worth, but if I leave I'll make WAY more money and probably won't finish my bachelor's degree.
   
   I already have 5 years of experience as a ""system admin"" but I want to move over to technical project management in the next 10 years.
   
   I think I should stay, make less money, continue growing my relationships in the Scholastic Network, and finish getting my Bachelor's degree. That way I can get past HR checks to become a Project Manager somewhere else.
   
   What should I do?


2. I’ve recently become the technical lead at my company. I need to build my team more but am struggling with one thing. How do I overcome the fear of hiring someone better than me who could potentially overtake me as the team lead? Is this a common fear among leaders? I want to build an effective team of high caliber developers. But I can’t do that if I let my ego and insecurity get in the way.
