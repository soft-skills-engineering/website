In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hi! I enjoy your podcast a lot, been listening to it almost since the beginning before I even started to work in tech :-) I'd like to keep this one anonymous, though.
   
   Iâ€™ve been working fully remote for a pretty small software company for a few years. The workload was very big in the beginning and I was learning a lot, but now I barely work a couple of hours every week and I'm mostly using what I already know. It's fine, but boring. I have plenty of time to get another job as well, which is exactly what I've been looking out for recently.
   
   I've been approached by a startup. They use many tech stacks across different platforms, so it would probably be a good place to learn a lot of new things. And the pay is better. But, they have an entirely different work culture compared to what I'm used to. They require people working there to be in office all the time, and work like 10hrs/day sometimes.
   
   It's my first time having the chance of working 2 jobs at the same time, so I was wondering could this actually work? What if the first company decided to take on another project soon and the workload increases again? If that happens should I tell them I have another job at the same time? I was wondering maybe you guys have had any similar experiences in the past you could share about... Thanks

2. I am living in Europe and got an offer from a FAANG company. I am on the one hand really excited about the opportunity but also a bit scared of the timezoneshift of 9 hours. The hiring manager already assured me that the team will plan meetings to fit into a 5 hour slot that works best for me. Meaning that I will have to work 6-11PM for sure and the rest is up to me. I have two kids (0 and 4 years old) and am excited to have more time in the afternoons with the family but I am also not sure how to adapt my life to such a schedule effectively to prevent burnout. What do you think about this (and please don't tell me to quit)?
