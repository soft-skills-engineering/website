In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I am a data scientist and have been at my company for 2 years. Each of the data scientists on my team specialize in a different area of the business (growth, marketing, etc). I have developed a reputation for being the expert in my area and have worked really hard to understand my domain.
   
   I have a new data science team member who works in an adjacent area and has expressed interest in learning more about “my” area. But every time I talk to him I find myself getting defensive and possessive (on the inside). I don’t want to share my area, and I like being known as the expert, and I don’t want him working on stuff in my domain. Any advice on how to be less territorial here?

2. Should I quiet quit?
   
   I'm a year in to a new job, and am doing well. I work for a large consulting company, and have been doing a decent amount of unpaid overtime by volunteering for internal projects that we can't bill to our clients! The extra 5-10 hours a week have been adding up, and I feel overwhelmed. I don't think the extra work is as appreciated as it should be. I've received lots of positive feedback, and my performance reviews have been fine.
   
   Am I getting taken advantage of?
   
   Will people notice if I step back and just do the bare minimum expected for my job?
   
   I like being useful, and do genuinely enjoy some of the projects I've volunteered for. They've probably also been good for my internal visibility, as I've gotten to have my name on some large internal announcements and have had some good face time with very senior people. If I end up sticking around here, it'll probably be good, and I wouldn't mind a promotion.
   
   But I'm exhausted, and it's starting to get in the way of my personal life, hobbies, and even client work sometimes. I'm also wondering if that time would be better spent on upskilling or open source or something outside the company. How far can I cut back without repercussions?
