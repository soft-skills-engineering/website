In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Kate asks,
   
   Hi Dave and Jamison!
   
   I'm in a situation where my predecessor, Jane, was a super helpful "Mary Poppins" type. She did anything and everything beyond her role for the sake of being a team player. I was told she even went as far as providing homemade snacks for meetings.
   
   I, on the other hand, am a one trick pony; I only do the tasks I’m paid for. I'm often indirectly compared to her and worry I’ll be seen as an inadequate despite doing my duties well.
   
   Should I go with the “ol reliable”? Or wait to see if her legacy fades? Thank you so much!!

2. I’ve been involved in a project (architecture, design, code review) that has been ongoing for several months now, and I’ve put many hours and days supporting the project success, but only on the engineering side and not the PM. The obligatory announcement email blast came not too long ago, and my name was dropped from the pretty long list of people who have been involved with the different aspects of this project.
   On one hand, I feel that I should have been acknowledged for my contribution to the project success, especially when exposure to LT is at play here, but on the other hand I don’t want to play politics at work, I want to make great products for our customers while learning a lot and working with smart people.
   
   My question is should I care? I hate the fact that it’s even bothering me.
