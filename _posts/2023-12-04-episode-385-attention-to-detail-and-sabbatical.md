In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hello! Thank you for your podcast, I definitely find the episodes to be helpful. Lately Iâ€™ve been struggling with attention to detail. I just forget to do simple things like run pre-commit hooks before I put in a PR or before merging a PR. I went through a pretty bad layoff when my old company went bankrupt a few months back and now I am at a new role where I really like everyone I work with. The engineers expect checked-in code to pass tests and typechecks and be generally high-quality. How I can be better about attention to detail as a software engineer? How do you keep track of remembering all the little things that need to be done?

2. Hey guys I'm around 8 years into my career as a software engineer, been at a few companies and have been promoted to senior during my time. I like my job and have done relatively well in my career, but I'm burned out. While I think this is the best industry for me, I'd just like to walk away from the corporate 9-5 for who knows how long.
   
   Fortunately, I'm in a position where my partner is able to be the breadwinner for the foreseeable future. We've talked about it, and she's okay with it as long as I don't sit on the couch doing nothing all day. I figured I'd take this time to watch the kids, learn some skills around the house, get involved in the community, etc. I don't know if I'd ever want to get back in the software saddle, or if I do, perhaps I'd return in a different role or capacity.
   
   But my question is, if I leave this industry for several years and decide to ever come back, what would the landscape be like for me? Am I making a mistake by deciding to hang it up at such a young age?
