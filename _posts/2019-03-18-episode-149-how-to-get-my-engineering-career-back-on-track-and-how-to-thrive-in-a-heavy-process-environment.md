Joining us this episode is special guest <a href="https://twitter.com/AminiNedda">Nedda Amini</a>!

In this episode, Nedda, Dave, and Jamison answer these questions:

1. My engineering career started out pretty promising. But along the way, I took a couple of unfortunate decisions and jobs, that instead of helping me grow as an engineer, were a big setback. When you career takes a few too many bad turns, how do you steer it back to where you want it to go?


2. I work on product development with ~25 other developers, and management recently had us all embark on a journey to gain some level of CMMI appraisal. The goal is to deliver higher quality software at a more predictable pace. In practice this means that we got more processes to follow, more meetings to attend and more time-tracking fuss.
   
   I’m trying to keep an open mind because I, as a programmer, also have high standards for the product and it’s development. I'm scared that programmers are being turned in to factory workers stripped of any autonomy. These new processes don’t allow me to do anything without my product owner’s approval. I’m afraid that it will limit my creativity and ultimately cause my work and the product to suffer.
   
   In this kind of scenario, what’s your advice for a programmer who often gets inspired to remove tech debt, tinker with our dev environment, and otherwise make small improvements and refactorings that shouldn’t require management approval?
   
   What’s your opinion on the level of freedom that programmers should be provided in order to do their job well?
