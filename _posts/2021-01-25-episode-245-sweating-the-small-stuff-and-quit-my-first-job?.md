In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. Hello soft skills audio, love the show and your great advice.
   
   My question is how do I stop sweating the small stuff.
   
   I have one colleague who either can’t spell, or types so fast the words make no sense and doesn’t correct the mistakes. Emails, comments in code, comments in PRs, presentations to management, everything is a garbled mess and makes us look bad as a team.
   
   Another colleague just can’t stop talking in ‘business speak’. Every conversation is twice as long as it should be because they need to ‘touch base on what’s happening in this space and will circle back’
   
   These are by no means ‘quit your job’ problems. How do I avoid eye rolling and getting frustrated over something so minor?


2. I've been working at a software company for almost 10 years now. It's an amazing company, 5 minutes from where I live, with a really good culture. I have an awesome role as a senior developer working with interesting new technologies, a lot of flexibility, responsibilities and a valued opinion on both technological and company-wide matters. However, this is still my first job.
   
   I've invested a lot of time and effort on career growth the last few years but I feel like there are only a few developers at my company who share the same level of enthusiasm and the need to grow as I do. I've been able to bring in new tech, introduce modern practices and share knowledge with my colleagues, but it feels like I'm the only one who's actively pushing for this.
   
   Since this is my first job, I don't know if this is the case in other places as well. I've done some freelance projects on the side to learn more about how things work somewhere else  but mostly I'm the only senior dev on these projects.
   
   On the one hand I have a job that I love, on the other hand I don't really know what's out there. I feel like I might regret it later if I don't try something else but based on other people's experiences, I know it's hard to find a company with such a good culture and understanding as where I am right now. Switching jobs would also give me a significant salary increase, but will require a longer commute. There are only a few software companies in my area.
   
   Can you help me figure out if I should take the blue pill or the red pill?
