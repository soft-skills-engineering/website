In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hello there!
   
   To say things pretty directly, I hate the recruiting process in software engineering, especially coding tests on whiteboard during interviews. It makes me very nervous and I already missed a job opportunity because I could not handle my stress correctly. Plus I think that the problems asked in those interviews are irrelevant to the day-to-day job, which means that I need to study again sorting algorithms and tree balancing every time I want a new job.
   How do you deal with those interviews? Do you do heavy preparation? Do you think that the interview process is stupid too? Should the permanent access to StackOverflow be stated as an elementary dev's right :D ?
   
   Thank you very much, keep on the excellent job :)


2. I'm in my mid 30s and have been coding for about 20 years, I have a non-technical bachelor's degree and have had a fairly varied career. I did freelance web development work throughout college, and then after college had a couple of different jobs as the sole in-house web developer for two different small media companies. After that I spent some time running my own web dev/design business with some partners, freelanced some more, and then finally decided to get on the career track about 4 years ago. At that point, I ended up taking a remote developer job at a small company of about 8 people with no real hierarchy or management structure and worked there for 3 years.
   
   About 6 months ago, I moved on from there to what now feels like my first "real" job at a tech focused company (still remote), and while I'm happy with the work and compensation, I'm realizing that I'm at the bottom of the software developer hierarchy and there are many people above me who are a fair bit younger and, I assume, less experienced than I am. I don't mind being subordinate to younger devs, but I do feel like my career is a good 5 or 10 years behind where it should be because until now I haven't worked in an environment where it has been possible to earn a senior, lead, or management title. I've been coding for a long time and am very interested in moving up the ladder, leading a team and working more at the product level. Do you have any advice for how I can accomplish this quickly and make up for lost time - especially considering I've only been here for 6 months?
