In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. Many engineers want to go into product management, but I'm the reverse - a product manager who wants to move into engineering.
   
   What advice would you give to someone pursuing this path? How would you recommend I spend my time while jobfinding? What type of job should I be looking for?
   
   I have a computer science degree but I've worked as a PM for 10 years, so... it's been a while. I've pursued various side projects over the years and have a basic working knowledge of lots of things (e.g. android, ios, react, python, computer vision, firebase/serverless functions, databases, algorithms/data structures) but not much depth in any area.
   
   I know one option is to convert at the company you're already at. Take that off the table for a moment and say it has to be at a new company.


2. I recently just quit my first tech job for higher pay at another company. Upon turning in my two weeks notice, my boss coxed me into agreeing to work as a contractor to finish a project I've been working on.
   
   His argument is that no one else on the team has been involved in my project, is familiar with the tech stack, and has any time to help anyway. I'm finding I don't have time after the 40 hours I'm putting in at the new job but don't quite know how to sever ties. I feel like I'm the bad guy. Family and friends all say that It's not my problem and I should move on... being familiar with the project and company, I can't help but feel differently.
   
   How can I sever ties and get over the feeling of being the bad guy, especially after kind of leading on my employer about contract work the last two weeks, or how can I convince family and friends that this is something I should do to avoid burning a professional bridge.
