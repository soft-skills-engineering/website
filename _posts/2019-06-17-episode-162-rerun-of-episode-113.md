In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. How do I quit my first job if I'm working with a manager I love?

   I started my first full-time job about two years ago and I'm starting to think about looking for a new job, both because I am ready for new challenges and I'm ready to move to a new city.

   I have a great working relationship with my boss, so a part of me wants to tell her about my interest in finding a new job, both so that I could use her for a reference and also so that I can be honest with her about my intentions. She's been a great boss and mentor to me, so there's a part of me that doesn't want to jeopardize our working relationship. But another part of me feels like I might be jeopardizing my presence in my current office if I make it clear that I am looking to move on, especially if my job hunt doesn't go as smoothly as I hope.

2. How do you deal effectively with rapidly increasing work responsibilities?

   My technical lead was recently promoted to management. Being both ambitious and the only Sr. Engineer without retirement plans in the next 4 months, I immediately stepped into the power vacuum and inverted a binary tree faster than all my coworkers to establish my position as new tech lead. After a few months the **other** senior engineer on my team retired, and I've ended up holding the bag for my new job responsibilities, my old responsibilities as a Sr. Engineer, AND the departed Sr. Engineer's responsibilities.

   I told my manager how much was on my plate and that I was afraid my work output would suffer, and her response was to throw money hand over fist at me and promise to backfill both Senior positions within the next 12 months.

   How do I get through the next 18 months without losing all my hair? Are there any strategies to make sure the team doesn't go up in flames when I forget about a key deadline? Or at least position myself so that nobody can tell it is my fault until I can make a subtle getaway in the brand new Ferrari I'm going to buy?
