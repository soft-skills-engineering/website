In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I run a small dev team. One junior developer constantly openly challenges things that don't meet this their preference. As a manager I don't want to stifle innovation, but need to find a balance on being able to meet business goals on schedule.
2. I want to add an automatic formatting tool to our code, but my co-worker is resistant to the idea. He started this project and I'm brand new to it.  I don't want to push it too much, but I would really love to use it. I've shared with him all the reasons that it would be good, and addressed most of his concerns. I've also submitted a PR to show him what it would look like.  Also, he is in another timezone 9 hours away, so communication is all on GitHub, Slack, and the occasional video call (if I wake up early).  He finally said if it really helps me, then I can go for it, but I don't think he would like it if I did. Should I go for it? Try to convince him more? Or just drop it?
