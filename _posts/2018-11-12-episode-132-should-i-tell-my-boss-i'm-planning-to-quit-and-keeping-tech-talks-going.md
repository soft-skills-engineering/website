In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Recently I was approached by a manager and informed that I needed to decide if I wanted to stay at the company or not. I initially said I would like to stay, and was told there was some negative feedback from coworkers I'd need to work on to do so. I agree that these were issues I need to work on to become a better engineer, so I've engaged in something like a performance plan with her over the last few weeks. But I've decided that I don't want to stay after all, and I've started sending out applications.
   
   I don't want to burn bridges when I do end up putting in notice, but I also would like to continue working with her on these issues, and I'm worried if I declare I am leaving that will end. So my question is: should I tell my manager I've changed my mind, or stay quiet?


2. We used to have regular "tech talks" in the office - opportunities for people to share something they find interesting that doesn't have to be work related but usually is tech/development focused.
   
   The talks were 30-45 minutes in length, and there used to be free food (at a place that doesn't normally do that kind of thing)
   
   I wasn't here at the time when it last fizzled out, but used to give similar talks at my last company and I'm interested in starting them up again here. People *say* they're interested now but the novelty of free food eventually wears off - do you have any suggestions as to how to sustain people's interest in attending giving talks?
   
   I might be able to convince a few people I work more closely with but there's 60+ or so technical people in this office I'm still getting to know.
