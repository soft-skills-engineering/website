In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Is it possible to move too fast and do you believe in too much enthusiasm? I am one of the youngest member of the team and am always willing to start new projects and balance a few different things.  Is there a point where this can start hurting my career?  I've gotten bumped in compensation fairly, almost 25% raise since I first started.
   My career goal is to stay on the programming side but want to become a possible trainer for newer engineers/devs.

2. Listener Michael asks,
   
   I'm a backend engineer in an engineering/coding role with a small bit of SRE type work. I love the work as I get to dig deep into tech we use and have become subject a matter expert on databases within the company. I really like my team and my manager in particular, and get to learn a lot every week.
   My manager is leaving my team to lead a new team within the company that is focused on the company's SaaS offering and I've been given the option of joining this new team if I wish. I like their managerial style and how they have helped me with my career progression so far. However, I'd be doing Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) work. I'm not sure if I'm ready yet to commit to being an SRE and code less/focus more on ensuring the reliability of mission critical production systems. I don't know how easy it would be to switch back to more of a coding role in a years time or if it would pigeonhole me into that type of role. Have you got any advice?
