In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. Starting to work on a team that is split across time zones. With a majority of the company based in one time zone and a handful spread in others. I want to emphasis the importance of asynchronous communication. I have found Slack to begin to feel like I need to respond ASAP instead of when it is convenient.
   
   If we were to say slack is used for asynchronous communication, is asking the team to use signal or even text appropriate for a quicker response?
   
   What is a good way to reach out to team members in cases where a response is needed more immediately?


2. After about 1 year at my developer job, I was moved to work for a client company helping them launch a new product. This other client had different plans, it turns out, and now I'm just testing their API for them. That's fine but I never get questions answered and I hate my job with my client and hate my job with this company that sells me like a cheap piece of meat. I want to quit, I will quit, but I have a lot to say about why I'm quitting.  How can I NOT be nice about quitting and the reasons I'm quitting, and still feel comfortable showing my face in the industry again?
   
   I haven't quit a job before, and this is my first job in the tech industry. Searching how to quit a job always comes with "remain light and positive.
