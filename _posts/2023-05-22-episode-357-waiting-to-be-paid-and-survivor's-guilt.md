In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. A listener Steve asks,
   
   How long is too long to wait to be paid?
   
   I've worked for 4 early stage startups in my career. Two were successful. One failed. My current one is "limping along" but showing signs of taking off.
   
   At the startup that failed, we stopped getting paid and some of us stuck around for 2-3 months until the CEO closed the business. I ended up unpaid for nearly 3 months of work.
   
   At my current startup, we are 3 months behind, and it has been this way for 6 months. The CEO is transparent about fund raising and clients slow in paying invoices.
   
   My question is still how long before I follow your age old advice?

2. Listener Jess asks,
   
   â€Œ
   
   How do I get past survivors guilt when my company does mass layoffs, but I am not one of the casualties? I've been at the company less than a year, and this is the second time they've fired THOUSANDS of people, including from my team; folks I work with at least weekly, and folks who have been at the company significantly longer than I have. I feel guilty that I, "The new guy", am still employed, but the folks who've been there for years aren't. How can I get past this and keep working to ensure I'm not caught up in the next round of layoffs? My manager says I'm doing good work, and the layoffs included complex inputs, but it that only helps a little bit.
