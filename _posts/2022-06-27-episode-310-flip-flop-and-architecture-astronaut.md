In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hey guys! Love the show!
   
   I've worked for 8 years as a Software Engineer for a large aircraft company, and while I had a great time there, I left because I was tired of working with old tech and wanted to learn new stuff.
   
   I joined a medium-size company, working with lots of fun new tech, but after 8 months I got the opportunity to get my dream job as a Software Engineer at a specific Big Tech company.
   
   The problem is that after I started on my dream job, I "crashed" really hard. The people and org are great, but the job revolves around working with a large legacy product, using mostly old/basic tech, and overall I've been feeling really unmotivated since joining.
   
   After 4 months there, I was called by my previous fun job, and they offered me twice as much as I'm making at this Big Tech company to come back.
   
   I'm very tempted, but I'm afraid of screwing my resume by leaving so early.
   Should I toughen up and stick with my new fancy job, or go back and make more money and maybe be happier? 

2. Hello Dave & Jamison,
   
   First time, long time - I am 6 months into my first engineering job and loving it! (until recently...) my large team split into smaller teams. On my old team, we had lots of work to do and it was fun. My new team, however, is suffering from "spin-up time." My tasks have shifted from clearly defined individual contributor type tasks, to amorphous research tasks on large architectural decisions. After about 3 months of this, it feels like this spin-up time is never going to end and we just don't actually have much work coming our way.
   
   On the one hand, these are more senior engineering type tasks and I could probably learn a lot if I stay to see these through.
   
   On the other hand, I am certainly not at a senior engineer level and I miss spending my time coding. It was fun and I was learning a lot from that too. I fear that I may be atrophying as I haven't done much coding for multiple months.
   
   On the third hand (I have three hands),  I could definitely be making more money elsewhere.
   
   Should I stay and be patient, or is it time to take the magical SSE advice? is the economy crashing? I need help!!!
   
   Thanks, you guys are the best,
   Johnny Threehands
