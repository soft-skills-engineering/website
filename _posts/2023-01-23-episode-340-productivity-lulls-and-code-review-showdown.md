In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. A listener Daniel asks,
   
   How do I handle periods of time where I am just not productive as I used to be? I'm talking about periods of several weeks. For example, when your kids are ill all the time (daycare fun) or you are down because of XYZ.

2. How do you turn not really constructive feedback into useful feedback?
   
   I have a difficult time dealing with PR reviews from a specific colleague. They have a way to push my buttons somehow, it's like even when they are actually right, the way they approach the subject or how nit picky their comments are just make it hard to take the feedback or start a healthy discussion. It prompts me to become confrontational. I know it's not good to react like this, but I don't feel comfortable talking directly to them about it to try to smooth things out. I don't think its personal as I've seen this kind of comments on other people's PRs too.
   
   I am aware this might be me being overly sensitive, but its like every time he is the one reviewing my PR I get the feeling of "oh, not this guy again" and need to mentally prepare for his comments. I'd like to find a way to take the core of the feedback that might be useful and kind of ignore the rest that might feel dismissive or opinionated, and I thought you might have some tools for this.
   
   The main reason I care about it is that this reflected badly on my latest performance review, as I had stellar feedback in general and the only improvement areas were that I should learn how to deal with mistakes or negative feedback better. I am aware it can be a weak point on me , but I know that a big part of that comment from my manager comes from my interactions with this specific colleague.
