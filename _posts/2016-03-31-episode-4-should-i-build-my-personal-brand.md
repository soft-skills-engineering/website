In episode 4, Jamison and Dave answer this question:

I have heard a lot about "marketing myself" and my "personal brand". For example, some people say I should be writing a blog post every week or creating lots of YouTube content. They talk about being a "thought leader". I love building stuff as an engineer, and obviously I want to have a great job, so how important is this stuff?
