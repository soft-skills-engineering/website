We've got another re-run this week, as Jamison and Dave both recover from being sick. We'll be back with a new episode next week.

In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. How can I attract talent?
2. How do I quit without burning bridges?

This episode originally aired on November 15th, 2016.
