In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I've been working at a big software company for two years.
   Since joining, 10 people have left my team, which is more than 50% of my team. Usually it's the experienced developers who leave either for a different team, a different role or a different company altogether.
   
   The latest departure of a peer who I've been looking up to as a brilliant developer has been affecting my mood quite strongly. On one hand, I should be glad that I'm becoming a more pivotal member of the team, having moved up in the "seniority chain". On the other hand, I've always believed the saying: "If you're the smartest person in the room, then you're in the wrong room".
   
   Should I be concerned about this turnover rate? Is it considered normal? Why am I feeling different about this last departure than all of the previous ones?


2. I am the tech lead on a team at a large tech company. One of the developers on our team has consistently struggled to meet deadlines and project deliverables. He frequently seems to invent his way into impossibly complex software problems. Additionally, he also seems to lack the ability to focus on a single thread, and tries to tackle diverse kinds of work in parallel. I've tried to help mentor and coach him, advising him to stick to one problem at a time and try to raise his hand and has for help before he backs himself into a hermeneutically sealed NP-hard problem â€” but I haven't had much success. I wanted to see if you guys had any advice. Thanks a million!!!
