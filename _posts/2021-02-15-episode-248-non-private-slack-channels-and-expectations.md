In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. Our engineering manager keeps sneaking/creeping on our private slack channels. As an admin of the workspace he can join any private slack channel without being invited.
   
   I feel like this is an unacceptable behavior. What should I do?
   Should I just reach out to him and ask him not to abuse his admin privileges?
   Should I setup a discord server for me and my fellow developers?
   Or should I take the soft skills engineering advice and quit my job?


2. Thank you guys for your awesome podcast.
   
   I have recently begun my foray into management with the reception of my first subordinate.  I selected him due to his illustrious undergraduate project presentation and his ability to expound on the intricacies of said projects.  But, I'm having a hard time managing my expectations.  He is unable to complete the simplest of tasks, often going off on tangents that, despite being given the answer, result in spending hours in unrelated rabbit holes.  Additionally, he asked for a high salary and was promised an increase scheduled ahead of review.
   
   As a first-time manager, I worry that I am inflicting unrealistic expectations especially since software is my passion. I enjoy learning learning new languages and technologies.
   
   What is the best way to let him know that he is not meeting expectations?  How can I say this without my typical brashness which will ultimately result in me blurting out something to the tune of "you aren't nearly as capable as you made yourself out to be"?
