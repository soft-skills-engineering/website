In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Greetings! I have been with my current company for a number of years, and was recently promoted to Engineering Manager. I enjoy working here, and have a great manager and team. A job posting at another company recently piqued my interest (great salary, appealing company values, fully remote) and got me thinking, would it look terrible if I applied for, or switched jobs, so soon after a promotion to management?

2. How can I figure out if communication problems with a team member are cultural or personal? My teammate immigrated to the states. We occasionally stumble over conversation and misunderstand each other. I think this is exacerbated by being remote. For example, they will ask a pointed and direct question that sounds like a challenge to my approach to a problem. When I attempt to answer, it's clear we are nowhere near the same page and I need to back up and provide more detail.
   
   I am working and have worked with others who immigrated from the same country. I've had similar difficulties connecting before that I have not had with other teammates from other regions.  However, this is not universally true of every teammate I've had from this area.
   
   If it is a cultural style, I would rather learn to adapt. I'm not interested in suggesting everyone need to conform to my cultural sensibilities. But if I can determine it's a personal difficulty, we can work on it together.
