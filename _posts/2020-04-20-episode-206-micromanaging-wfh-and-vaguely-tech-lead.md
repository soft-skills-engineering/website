In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Due to corona virus, we had to work from home. But the manager, is checking up on us very frequently. We have to give the day's plan at 10:00am sharp, otherwise he assumes that we are taking the day off. Also, we have to send an email listing the things we did at the end of the day. This is on top of using jira. I feel he is micromanaging a lot and because of this, the team isn't able to work efficiently. P.S. Now he wants us to add our tasks to a Google sheet.


2. Hi Dave + Jamison,
   
   First of all, thank you for putting on the show every week. It is definitely my favorite podcast by a wide margin, every Monday I just keep hitting refresh waiting to get my weekly fix.
   
   I started my job about 10 months ago in a late stage startup. In my last annually review, I was recognized for all my hard work and was made into a "Tech Lead". I am not sure what this means. There is no "tech lead" title in the company wiki. Everyone title is just "software engineer" with a level. The salary adjustment definitely suggest this is not a promotion, and the all important company wiki says I need to wait to get promoted anyway. What is your advice? What should I start doing now, what does it mean for my career?
