This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. My peers give up and say "have it your way" whenever we have technical discussions. How do I get them to be more vocal about their opinions?
2. I like the idea of measuring things, but metrics seem easy to game. How do I effectively measure team and personal productivity?

Jamison cites [this tweet](https://twitter.com/danluu/status/926492239081197569) and [this](http://malisper.me/how-to-improve-your-productivity-as-a-working-programmer/) blog post about examining your own productivity.
