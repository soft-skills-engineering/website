In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hi!
   I am 29 years old and a couple of years ago I decided to turn my career around by going from teaching history to frontend development.
   After 2 years of education I am now doing my first internship in small but established company. I have the feeling I will soon be offered a full-time position.
   
   How can I ask for the best job offer (salary-wise) accordingly to my age but few experiences? I don't want to be perceived as ungrateful, nor be exploited and get underpaid.


2. How do you know that you are a senior engineer? Not just the title you are given, but when do you really feel like one? Some people relate this to experience, but you can be coding or doing crappy stuff for 10 years so for me this is not the answer.
