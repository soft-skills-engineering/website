In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. Hello,
   I have been working as a software developer for 10+ years now and recently took a job at a non-technical company.
   
   I was recruited to craft a web app for this company and thought they had an idea of what it means and the changes it may require.
   
   I am the only developer on the project. I feel like, either I'm not communicating well/at all, or they just simply don't care about the work they recruited me for.
   I don't have a good work/life balance since I'm always anxious when I receive an email from the company fearing someone will complain about the quality of my software. I feel isolated and unable to show how my work positively impacts the company
   
   Since I know my work is not perfect, I feel like I should not complain at all and just make my software bug-free. I'm doubting my abilities and starting to think I actually don't know anything about Software Engineering.
   
   Because the company is non-technical, do I have the right to say that my work is that essential? What should I do so I don't feel like crap every morning before going to work?


2. In your last episode, you brought up a listener question about a developer of **eight** years accepting a senior developer position. I'm in a similar boat, but with far less experience. How much less? Well I've worked as a developer only for THREE. This is by no means a flex, but I'm kind of worried that I'm in over my head. There was little due diligence on my new supervisor's side, so my trepidation is that I'll be two/three months into my new job and they'll look at my perf and see "this kid is not a senior at all". I know, the classic imposter syndrome. I've been straight forward with my new supervisor about my experience level—or lack thereof—and they seemed not too worried about it. Do you guys have any advice for me going into this? What can I do to maximise this opportunity I've been given this early in my career? Love the show!
