In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. My architect is too busy with his kids! His kids have had a lot of school and medical issues over the last few months and he's ended up flexing a lot to take care of them. This causes meetings to get rescheduled or scheduled far out in the future, which is contributing to timeline delays on some large projects that need more attention.
   
   I don't want to be rude and insist that he put the company above his family, but he needs to be driving organizational alignment, not his kids! I'm stressed out by not knowing when he'll be available and having to do extra work or take important meetings without having him as backup!

2. â€Œ
   
   Can you help me understand what happened here? I was put on a 'performance improvement plan,' and it became pretty clear to me from the negative feedback at my first review that I simply didn't have the skill to perform at the level that was being asked for. Instead of immediately looking for a new position, I decided to take some personal time off to work on myself and my mental health, and to use the remainder of the performance improvement plan time to prepare myself emotionally and financially for that. I didn't blow off work, but I also wasn't invested in the performance improvement plan either. A few days before my final review, I quit instead of being terminated. Management seemed really confused and angry when I quit. Why would they be so upset if they were about to terminate me anyway? One in particular started backtracking and pretending like I wasn't going to be terminated.
