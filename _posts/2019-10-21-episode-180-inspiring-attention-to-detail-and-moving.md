In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. How do I inspire attention to detail in my co-workers?
   
   I've been frustrated with another developer on my team who pays a lot less attention to detail and it results in many bugs that I end up fixing, and sloppy commit history which makes debugging issues more difficult. I received a suggestion from a mentor to reframe my thinking from: I failed to enforce good practices, to, I failed to inspire good practices.
   
   
   
   Having approached the zen master, I'm hopeful for your additional advice / humour, what are some actions that I can take to help me on this path of inspiring vs enforcing?


2. I am planning to move to a new city for my significant other to get another job, and will likely need to leave my current job to do so. Should I tell my manager up front when we start looking for new jobs or wait until we are actually moving?
