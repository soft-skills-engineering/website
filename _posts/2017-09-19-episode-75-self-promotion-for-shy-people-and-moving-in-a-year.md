This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

2. What are some good ways for people who aren't good at self-promotion to promote themselves?
2. I'm moving to Europe in a year. How much notice should I give my company that I'm leaving?

Way back in [episode 26](https://softskills.audio/2016/09/12/episode-26-communicate-your-efforts-and-i-told-you-so/) we talked a little bit about self-promotion as well.
