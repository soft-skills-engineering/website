In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I recently told my boss I thought my comp was below market value and that, while I enjoy working here, I may have to start looking elsewhere for my next opportunity unless there was a way to adjust my salary. He actually agreed with me and said he would go to HR to see what he could do.
   
   A few days later, he came back to me and said they could do a market-rate adjustment of 20k per year. I was super happy. He said, "great I will let HR know that you accepted by EOD tomorrow and they will get the paperwork started."
   
   At 10am the following day, he, along with a couple hundred other employees, were laid off.
   
   So my boss, my boss's boss, my boss's boss's boss and the HR rep that my boss was talking to are no longer here.
   
   So my questions is, what's the appropriate amount of time to wait before bringing this up to my new boss. With so many of my colleagues now out of work , it seems a bit insensitive to be so concerned with a raise, but also, I like more money.

2. I am 8 months into my first job out of college in an entry level role and today the other new hire (4 months) got fired for poor performance. I have been assured that my performance is still satisfactory, but I have been unable to think about anything else since it happened. I know that I am probably fine, but I am still very shocked and on edge. Any advice on how to move past this without destroying my bloodpressure would be appreciated!
