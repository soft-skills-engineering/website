In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. Should I change tech stacks every few years in order to not get pigeonholed?
   
   Is it a good idea to stick with a tech stack for as long as I can or should I follow the market trend and try to learn another promising tech and then try switching into that?
   
   Would you advise me to be more of a specialist or a generalist early in my career, and what about later when I'm more experienced? I'm a full-stack web developer who's just starting out my first job (if that matters)


2. I love this show so much, I'm even trying your goto advice - quitting my job! But not untill I've got another lined up so shhh about it already. In the mean time, I work for a huge agency as a senior(ish) developer and have recently started work with a new team. However, they have issues: no one turns on their camera for video calls, which I'm ok with, but it makes the next bit worse somehow - most say the absolute minimum in response to any questions and offer no opionions / thoughts / ideas. It makes things like sprint retro meetings very awkward. We have a scrum master running our meetings who is clearly struggling to engage the team, I try to hold off to let any of the others answer questions but I always seem to end up picking up the slack. I've even started timing how long I'll let the slience endure before jumping in to answer, I'm now waiting 15 seconds. Have you come accross this before? How can I get people to engage more?
