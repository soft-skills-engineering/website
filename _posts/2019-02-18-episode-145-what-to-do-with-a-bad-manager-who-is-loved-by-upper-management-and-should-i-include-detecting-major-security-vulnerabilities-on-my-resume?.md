In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. How do I deal with the manager on my team who is both not very technical and positions himself as the “boss” spending almost no time with the team (except dragging everyone into more and more meetings! 😡) .
   
   My manager upsets and demotivates the team but not upper management and is clearly trying to climb the career ladders as fast as possible.
   
   Obviously everyone wants the team to succeed but the friction is growing. Some team members already left with (maybe too subtle) hints at the problem.
   
   Should one stage a coup and take over? Silently manipulate people to go to into “the right” direction? Switch teams/jobs and see it burn from the sidelines 🍿?


2. While testing my system at work, I was shocked how little security there was. Two issues exposed the entire system's data by just changing the query string. Also every API call had no backend check on the user making the call. These are just two examples of many.
   
   This is at a gigantic multi billion dollar institution handling hundreds of thousands of people's data, some of it incredibly sensitive. This fact will be known on my resume.
   
   This leads to my question: I am looking for a new job now, and wondering how much detail about these security issues is appropriate to share on a resume? I feel this helps me stand out as a newer dev, but would this be frowned upon by prospective employers that may worry I might overshare their own security issues?
   
   Thanks for all your help!
