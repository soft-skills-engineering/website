In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. How do you quit when you're indispensable to the team?
   
   I am the lead developer at a startup. I have a small team of 3 developers under me. I am essentially the "person who wrote all the code". I have an offer from another startup for more money and more percentages of the company and they want me over there asap.
   
   I'm afraid to quit this startup as I fear that it's not yet at a place where it could survive without me. I realize that sounds super egotistical but unfortunately I don't have a successor ATM and none of the other developers are at a level where I could potentially train them to be my successor in the time frame I have with the other offer.
   
   The other sticky thing is that the current startup probably doesn't have enough money to hire someone at my level for what they'd actually be worth. I, and the rest of the team, are severely underpaid, as this is a bootstrapped startup. Love your show, would love to hear your guys' take on this.


2. I recently interned at a local factory to help clean up some broken 20 year old databases. After remaking them, I quickly became a rising star and word spread fast of my aptitude. I was offered a full time salary position, in which I was able to negotiate for some special privileges and a cool title: software engineer.
   
   I am having an awesome time building little tools for various departments while learning different languages. I've been very fulfilled with the projects and recognition I've been getting, there's just one problem: the IT department absolutely despises me.
   They see my sole existence as an affront to their entire structure. I am a part of the engineering team and work very closely with product and process engineers, which is apparently hurtful to their ego.
   
   Lately, IT has been actively obstructing every project I work on and refusing many requests, sometimes with obviously false excuses. I do not have admin privileges, I have limited internet access, I'm not even allowed to have my email password. It's at a point where I start getting serious anxiety when I need to see IT (e.g. to install a framework or IDE extension).
   
   How can I navigate these awful encounters without letting it harm my view on the rest of the job? I am feeling like I need to wage war but I want to retain my golden boy status.
