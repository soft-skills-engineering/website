In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I recently took a job at a start-up as the only front-end developer. The distinction of front-end and back-end is new to me as all of my previous experience has been full stack development.
   
   Most of my work can only be started once a back end developer has done their part. There is only one back end developer who just so happens to be one of the co-founders of the company. Because he can't exclusively dedicate his time to back-end work due to his other roles with the company, I am left sitting at my desk writing to you guys trying to figure out what to do with all this free time I suddenly have. I'd like to stay busy and not just look busy.
   
   I'd appreciate any advice to help get me busy again!


2. Hey Dave and Jamison, love the show. Quit my job twice since I started listening so I'm a super fan.
   
   Long story short, I think I'm bored with coding(?). I just see everything as moving JSON around. Putting it in databases or putting it in queues or on a screen. I've done mobile, I've done backend, I've done front end, and it all just starts to look the same after a while. As an industry I feel we've solved the hard problems and now its degraded to this.
   
   What do I do next? Do I find a software product where the JSON moving around excites me (for example, a social good or cutting edge product)
   
   Do I look at something very different like embedded dev or games dev? (No JSON there!)
   
   Or do I look to tech leadership or people leadership? These options appeal but I'm just five years into my career and 26 years old and of course no one takes me seriously, naturally.
   
   However, I have been very deliberate and been very intense about my career, but now I'm feeling a bit done with coding. Team velocity problems interest me more than JSON APIs. People interests me more than code.
   
   I'd love to hear any of your thoughts on this!
   Thanks :D
   Keep up the great work.
