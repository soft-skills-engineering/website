In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I'm a senior front end engineer at a medium sized tech company.
   
   During the good times of limitless tech growth, a common way for engineers to grow our "impact" (an important criteria at many companies for promotion) was to find ways to lead/manage more people, whether this was becoming a manager and having more direct reports, or becoming a tech lead and mentoring more people, especially interns and junior engineers.
   
   Now, with many companies doing layoffs and hiring freezes (mine included), teams simply aren't growing and there just aren't as many people to "impact". What are some other ways to have more "impact" and grow my leadership skills? Both for hitting promotion criteria, but also for my own growth as an engineer that would like to be a manager or staff engineer someday.

2. I am a very senior engineer at my company. There is an engineer on the team less senior than me, but not under me on the management tree. This person is well regarded in the organization, but has a strong tendency to over-engineer things. Normally I don't mind a little over-complexity if it means that the person leading the project is taking ownership/accountability of the feature. But with this individual, they tend to be put in a place to make sweeping decisions that broadly impact systems when it's clear that they don't really have a full picture of what's going on. To make matters worse... when I raise these points directly, the person will usually offer to accommodate my concerns by further over-complicating their solution/architecture rather than stepping back and picking an approach more appropriate for the problem.
