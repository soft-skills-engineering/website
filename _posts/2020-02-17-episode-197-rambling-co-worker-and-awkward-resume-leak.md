In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Help! I have a co-worker who can't get to the point. They keep rambling, throwing in useless jargon, with veiled bragging of their knowledge and accomplishments, and answering questions that weren't asked; and all in a _very_ monotone voice. My brain starts to zone out now every time they start in to "explain" something.
   
   They also somehow survived at the company for 8+ years and have recently become a team lead. Our paths don't cross every day because we work on separate products, but I am interested in their team's product and might want to join them in a year or so.
   
   What do I do?


2. Listener Zezima asks,
   
   Hi! I've been at my current job for about a year and a half now. My boss says we should be getting more money and investors and will soon give everyone a raise. I've seen many people being hired and others given a raise but have not yet received one myself.
   I recently started applying to other jobs. I don't want to leave but want to learn my market value and get a slight increase.
   I was demoing some work in a meeting, and sharing my screen to do so. As I went to upload an image.... my RESUME file is open.
   `resume,coverletter,resumeadobe,resumeTesla`. I mashed the cancel button and bounced in to panic mode but continued like nothing happened. I hear some typing shortly after  closing. Did they see it? Are they talking about me...? Do they know I dont want to leave but just want some sort of compensation? These questions are going through my brain and I have no clue what to do. Should I call up the people in the demo and have a heart to heart?
