In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. My company is a startup and they're super unorganized. I'm a junior-mid level engineer, and when I was onboarded, there was no documentation for how to run anything. I wrote a bunch of documentation and also made some PR templates to try and organize PRs. I'm super annoyed because things are constantly being messed with in our schema, and I don't realize what we've changed until it correlates to a different issue that I'm trying to fix and then have to redo the fix because there's this new change. What can I do to help my company?


2. I'm a lead engineer at a small but growing startup. I work primarily on skunkworks projects. My teammate and I are feeling constantly underwhelmed by the performance of the rest of the engineering team, who are working on the core app. Their work causes limitation for us, makes the engineering team look ill-equipped, and we cant seem to make old dogs learn new tricks.
   How do we make it more apparent to the team, and the rest of the company, that it's time to "level up" the engineering domain as a whole.
