This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. My job doesn't seem to leave room to negotiate salary or raises for our year-end review. Is this normal? How do I negotiate in this process?
2. Can working part-time, when it's possible to work full time, to invest in personal development look bad to a future employer?
