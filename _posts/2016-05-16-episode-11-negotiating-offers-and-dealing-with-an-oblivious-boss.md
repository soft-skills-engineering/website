In episode 11, Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

I'm looking for a new job. How do I negotiate to get a better offer?

How do you deal constructively with a boss who is well-intentioned, reasonably nice and intelligent, but incompetent, oblivious, and who has minimal to no oversight on their work performance?
