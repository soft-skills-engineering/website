In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I wanted to know if listing past offers (as a brand name signal) on your resume will help or hurt you during the resume screening and interview stages?

2. I am an SQA engineer at one of the FAANGS, and I feel inadequate in my position; I get the gist QAs are not valued much. Essentially I got into this domain early in my career, and I find moving out of this role difficult. My long-term goal is to get into a PM role. Is that even possible, or should I first switch to the Dev role to build a better foundation? Help me. I am lost.
