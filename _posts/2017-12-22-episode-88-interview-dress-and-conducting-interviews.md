This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. How do you dress for interviews? Full on informal beach bum? Smart casual? Formal suit tie?
2. I'm a new developer and have been asked to interview incoming developers. How do I learn how to interview?

[This](http://blog.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-hiring-process) is the NoRedInk interview process. [This](https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/03/06/the-hiring-post/) is the blog post Jamison likes on getting data out of the technical portion of the interview. [This](https://zachholman.com/posts/startup-interviewing-is-fucked/) is a slightly pessimistic look at pitfalls in the standard interview process. Google wrote a great article about [structured interviewing](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/hiring-use-structured-interviewing/steps/introduction/) that might also be helpful.
