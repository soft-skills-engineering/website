In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I am a software developer and as such, i get paid nicely. My family doesn't think I work hard enough or deserve the money. Any advice?


2. I am a software developer that was promoted earlier this year. I received a 10% raise with this promotion. Since working for this company for some time, this is the first substantial raise I have received. Previous raises ranged from nothing to sub-inflation raises.
   
   Today, my manager informed me that at my annual review I would not be receiving a raise. My manager said this has nothing to do with my performance but more with the fact that I was given a raise with my promotion earlier this year. I was caught off guard by this and did not really know how to feel about this information.
   
   Does this seem reasonable? Is this something worth following up on with my manager? If so, what are good questions to ask?
