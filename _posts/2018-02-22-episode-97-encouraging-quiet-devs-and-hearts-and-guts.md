This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. We have a great intern, who is smart and has good ideas but is also very quiet.

   She's got a great deal of potential, and I want to tell her that being more vocal and assertive can help her greatly, both in her career and in life.

   How can I give her this feedback, without it sounding like a criticism of her personality, or her introverted tendencies?"

2. Recently a team member was let go. I am the team lead so I played a role in their termination. While they weren't a good fit for the team, I'd still like to be in touch and help them improve their skills. Should I steer clear of this? My gut says yes but my heart says no.
