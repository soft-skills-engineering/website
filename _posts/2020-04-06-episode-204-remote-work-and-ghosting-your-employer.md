In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. My whole team recently transitioned to working from home. How do I handle this? The good news is I don't have a fever.


2. Working remotely, what should you do if either you ghost the company or the company ghosts you? (Ghosting as in the relationship)
