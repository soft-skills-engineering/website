In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Great podcast! Love what you guys are doing and very happy that you are doing this for such a long time! Here's the question.
   
   I started to work in a Startup a year ago. When we were negotiating the salary we agreed on amount X, and CTO promised that after a year it will be increased. He did say the exact sum. So, the year has passed, I followed up CTO about the salary raise, and he delegated the task to the manager, who decided not to give me a raise. When I asked 'why?' he said that I am good at negotiating my salary and I'm getting what the market is offering. I don't feel bad about not getting more money, but the fact that the CTO break his word concerns me. I don't think I can trust this company when they are promising anything and I started to care less about what I'm doing here. Am I delusional that a programmers salary has to increase even by 2% on a yearly basis and how to find a way to trust company in the future? Or just drop this and take the default SSE case - look for another job?
   
   Thank you for your answer. 


2. Hi Dave and Jamison, Absolutely love the show.
   
   I share an office with a peer who works on my team. We are both early in our career and are lucky to work under a very hands off manager. However, I feel my peer is taking advantage of the situation and is slacking off. He is rarely in his office and often states that he is ""working"" from home. When he graces us with his appearance in the office, he asks the most basic questions. Granted, those questions are internal and specific (not easily Google-able), but still, I feel he should have known the answers after a year on the job.
   
   He intentionally exploits our monolith's slow builds by running full builds all the time and complain that it is slow. Then plays video games in the office until the build is complete (about 4 hours). Then makes a minor change in his feature code and kicks off a full build again, even though he could build incrementally (about 2-3 minutes).
   
   What do you recommend me to do? Should I spend time and energy to answer his lifeless questions? Should I confront him?
