This is a re-broadcast of episode 73 from August 2017. We'll be back next week with a new episode!

In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. A developer on my team has been rewriting my code under the guise of "code cleanup" without saying anything to me. Is this normal? What should I do?
2. How do you deal with co-workers who over-explain unimportant issues?
