In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hello! Love the show ❤️
   
   I'm 6 months into my career as a software engineer at a very large company.
   
   As a new engineer, I’m often lost and confused, especially since my team is working on a green field project. My mentor is very helpful and patient with me despite all of my questions. I’ve thanked him countless times and publicly called out his support at standup and in front of management basically everyday. But I still feel like this isn’t enough. He’d never say it, but I know I’m such a burden to him and slow down the team.
   
   Other than quitting my job to alleviate him from my near-constant “Please help” messages, how can I:
   
   1) show him how much his support has meant to me and get him the recognition he deserves
   
   2) stop being such a drain on his productivity/life
   
   Thank you!!


2. I'm a Senior Software Engineer, and I played the salary game with a recently promoted Mid-Level engineer on my team, who, in a gross violation of the rules, not only volunteered his own salary, but one of another Mid-Level engineer. In retrospect he was a bad one to play the game with.
   
   Anyway, it turns out they're both really close to me now, and are both making a good deal more than I was 5 years ago when I was promoted to Senior. This is mostly (maybe entirely) because I was a horrid negotiator when I first started at the company. It was my first ""real"" job, and it turns out I really lowballed the company during salary negotiations. I'm pretty ready to leave the company (for reasons both personal and professional), but I've submitted a talk proposal for an industry conference that takes place 6 months from now. In order to give the talk I'd need to still be employed by the company, so rather than ordering the Soft Skills Engineering Special and quitting my job, I'm going to give it a shot and ask for a 25% raise.
   
   My question is what advice do you have for this conversation? I've read all the usual ""state your value, don't make it personal, etc"" stuff, but do you guys have anything else that's been effective in your experience on either side of this?
