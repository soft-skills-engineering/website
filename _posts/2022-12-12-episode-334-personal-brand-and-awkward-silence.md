In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Long time question asker, first time listener. I recently started to go back through the original episodes of this podcast where a few episodes were themed were around networking, open source work, and building your personal brand. I just wanted to share my "NETWORK=NETWORTH" story. About a month ago my CEO was terminated by our board of directors, a week after it was announced that we were having layoffs for the vast majority of the company. I had been with this company for around 4 years, a lot of my work had been doing open source projects and interacting with various other companies. Unfortunately I was one of the people who was let go as part of these layoffs. I immediately reached out to various folks in the open source world that I've interacted with, seeing if their companies had any openings. Within two weeks I was able to interview and get an offer without a technical interview. Building my "personal brand", interacting with the open source community had turned a pretty stressful situation into one that was relatively a lot less stressful!

2. Listener Stochastic Beaver asks,
   
   I’ve recently joined a big tech company remotely and my team is super AWKWARD. No one says anything non-work-related in team chat. My manager is the only one with a camera on in team-wide meetings. I barely saw anyone's face. When I try to chitchat about their life during in 1:1s, somehow they don't feel like interested in talking about themselves so I eventually stopped asking anymore. In meetings, my manager is most vocal person within the team and the other people barely speak. As a result, it's always feels like my manager's one man show trying to make a conversation and discussion and throwing a joke and the responses are usually some 'lol' in the chat.
   
   It's not that the team members are not engaged to the team. Everyone is very passionate and I usually see their work related messages, code reviews, and emails coming back and forth after the evening, even in weekends. Is this normal that all the people are extremely shy in the same team? I like the work and the problem we're solving but sometimes I find that the silence in the air is suffocating me and I also want to establish a good relationship with my coworkers. Am I asking too much for them in 'work'? Thanks for listening.
