In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I was unhappy at my job despite having a great manager, so I started interviewing around. Then my manager helped improve things considerably, but I ended up getting a job offer that was for a much higher amount than I'm currently paid. My company gave me a counter offer that I accepted, but now I feel like I somehow betrayed my manager and don't know how to stop feeling guilty.
   How do I come back from a touchy salary negotiation incident like this and make things feel like they're normal again?


2. Compared to a smaller company which I used to work at, this new big company I'm working at seems to require more storytelling around the work that I do. I see people getting rewarded for exaggerating the effects of their work and being excused for their missed deadlines when they complain and blame the codebase. I hate to play this kind of game and would rather divert my energy on improving as an engineer and getting more code written. </rant>
   
   With all that said, I do understand the need for this and think it's a valuable skill.
