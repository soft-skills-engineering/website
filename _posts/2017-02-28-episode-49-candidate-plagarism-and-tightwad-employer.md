[Dave](https://twitter.com/djsmith42) and [Jamison](https://twitter.com/jergason) answer these questions:

1. What do I do if I suspect my co-worker plagiarized my homework assignment in their own interview?
2. My employer is making me provide my own laptop. Is this normal?

We mention [The Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/). Also remember to tweet about the show for  endorsements from [Dave](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-smith-8895461/) and [Jamison](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamison-dance-70469b28/) for completely serious and relevant skills like doomsday-bunker-building and yodeling.
