In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I'm an introverted person but am not afraid to present my work and have strong 1-1s. For the past few months, I've been working on a project with a coworker who is very extroverted and expressive compared to me. During meetings with higher ups to present our work and progress, he overpowers  me in conversation unwittingly. Most of the time, I feel he does a good job but other times I notice that he makes claims without gathering all the data. I'm much more deliberate and will let people know if I'm uncertain about something; But he is willing to just say something outright then later apologize if he was incorrect. I want to make sure that in meetings, I don't come across as weak. I'm pretty confident in my technical ability and am polite at work, but don't think I come across as very approachable due to my lack of expressiveness. Is this something I should work on?


2. Hey Jamison and Dave! I absolutely love your show and have listened to every episode. You guys keep me company on those commutes to work and keep me sane.
   Every quarter, we have an organization-wide demo. Usually, it's one person demoing the feature - usually the person who has been working on it most recently. For some of the features, I put in a lot of hard work and time into the feature but was later moved off to another project after completing my part. Essentially, I wrote the foundation of the whole feature. However, everyone has long forgotten that I ever contributed to it and I only found out it was even being demoed on the day of.
   I feel really disappointed my efforts aren't recognized, but is it too petty to care? From a career standpoint, I worry that the person demoing will get a lot more visibility from leadership and it will lead to faster career growth for them. What are your thoughts? Thanks!
