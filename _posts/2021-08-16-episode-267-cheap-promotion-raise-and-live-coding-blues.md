In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. I work for an all-remote company and I'm about to get promoted. The company says they target a salary increase of 5-10%. Assuming they come to me with an offer on the low-end (5-6%), what's the best way to go about negotiating a higher raise during promotion? I want to stay at the company and also want the shiny new SENIOR job title, so I feel like I don't have much leverage in this situation. Any advice is appreciated!


2. Rachel asks,
   
   Live coding makes me choke. As soon as someone else is watching, my brain immediately goes to mush and I'm like a chicken with my head cut off. Actually recently I learned it's not just live coding -- it extends to live spreadsheet-making and live cooking as well! I guess I'm not into performing? Anyway, this has come up because it's impacting my career in real ways. For interviews I offer to do takehomes, which I'm great at, but sometimes I'm told live coding is the standard they apply to all applicants. What's a non-live coder to do?
