In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. NK:
   
   Hi, I am starting a SWE internship at big tech company in a few weeks. Given the current state of the market, getting a return offer has gotten harder. I have a few software internships under my belt at this point but I am looking to excel in this internship. My goal is to get a full time offer with high pay from this internship. What are the soft skills that are specifically important for interns? This is probably applicable to junior engineers as well.

2. Hello Soft Skills, I'm a junior engineer who transitioned from an intern to a full-time role at my company a year ago. I anticipated training in development, but I'm stuck in a low-value automated QA role without proper leadership or team integration. My efforts to improve processes and change teams haven't been successful, and I'm concerned about being pigeonholed early in my career. I need advice on how to initiate change with limited authority and create a competitive job application despite my limited traditional development experience.
