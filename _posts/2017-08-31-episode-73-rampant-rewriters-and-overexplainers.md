Jamison and Dave will be at the UtahJS Conference on September 18th. See [conf.utahjs.com](https://conf.utahjs.com) for more info and to buy tickets. Come say hi!

This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. A developer on my team has been rewriting my code under the guise of "code cleanup" without saying anything to me. Is this normal? What should I do?
2. How do you deal with co-workers who over-explain unimportant issues?
