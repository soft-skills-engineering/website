In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hello! I am the only principal architect in my department. In addition to technical and delivery obligations, I am also responsible for mentoring of engineers. Recently, I reviewed some
   very lackluster customer facing presentation materials drafted by a junior engineer (for which I provided templates and talking points) and informed them this would need to be worked again from scratch. I received verbal confirmation that the effort was indeed lacking, and that they would take a different approach. Imagine my surprise when I was pulled into an HR meeting by my manager, telling me a formal complaint was filed for my being 'belligerent'. Also mentioned to me was that this engineer would be leaving the company because they couldn't possibly continue to work with me. Now might be a good time to mention we are a completely remote team and this is the first negative feedback this engineer received from me (due to having only been on the team for 2 weeks at that time). This individual has moved into a different group which I work with often, but now I'm concerned about having someone on the team who cannot handle direct (but professional) criticism. How do I handle this professional relationship going forward? P.S. this engineer is nearly 40 and we are consultants in 100% customer facing roles.


2. Hi Soft Skills Advisors, I think I may have been ""soft demoted"" at the start-up I work at. I used to be part of the senior management of the company as the most senior technical member of the staff. However, due to a series of unfortunate mistakes on my part (both technical and managerial), I seem to be no longer trusted or included in any discussions or decisions. I feel like I'm demoted from my position in everything but official title. And yet, everyone in the senior management reassures me that they still very much value all my contributions.
   
   Is it time to take the time-honored soft skills advice and "quit my job", or am I just being unnecessarily emotional and paranoid here and it will just take some time to rebuild trust?
   
   (I'm paid a good salary and still have my stock options, etc.)
