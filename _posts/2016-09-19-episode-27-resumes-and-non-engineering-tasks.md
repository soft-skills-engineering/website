In episode 27, Jamison and  Dave answer these questions:

## How do I write a great resume?

- Do you really need a resume these days?
- How important is formatting and good design?
- What content should be on your resume?

## Should I push back on non-engineering tasks like PowerPoint presentations?

From listener samspot: I am a Sr. Developer and I am often asked to spend time on PowerPoint
presentations for funding and other business stuff.  I want to ask why the managers, analysts,
etc can’t handle these tasks. I find them to be a frequent distraction from my actual
responsibilities, especially because these are so frequently “emergency” requests. Should I
push back on this work, or is it better to be a team player?
