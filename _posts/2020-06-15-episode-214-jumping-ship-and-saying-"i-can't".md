In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. We have just today been told that we may or may not have a job in 1 week. I feel lucky because I handed my notice in yesterday for a new job, but my colleagues are not in such a position. The company burned through all it's money, and its only hope is that someone or some company who wants to buy the business in its current state.
   
   How would you approach a situation like this? Is it best to just jump ship right away? What would potential new employers think when you told them the situation? What about my co-workers?


2. Long time listener, first time <del>caller</del> asker.
   
   How do I tell my boss I can't complete a task?
   
   I've been with my current company for 6 months. In that time I've fixed a lot of problems that have blocked our current embedded system project because of my hardware design background. Sometimes I take a bit longer than projected, but I've been upfront about that and it's all fine.
   
   I was trying to implement a new feature and it was meant to take around 3 days of work to do, but after 3 weeks I just couldn't quite get it to work. I asked for help and pulled out every trick in my arsenal and just couldn't figure it out. I ended up having to tell my boss that I was out of ideas and letting him tell me to shelve it, but I could tell this disappointed him.
   
   What should I do next time?
