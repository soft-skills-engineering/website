A listener named Dan talks about ThanksBot, an internal tool at Facebook to support gratitude.

[Dave](https://twitter.com/djsmith42) and [Jamison](https://twitter.com/jamison_dance) answer these questions:

1. I became an engineer because I loved my programming assignments and CS degree. However, at work I'm struggling to contribute beyond competing the tasks assigned to me. How do I participate more in broader technical solutions, process, etc?
2. I recently started a new job, and a lot of the existing code is really bad. How can I raise this concern, or make improvements to the code, without offending my teammates who wrote it? Thanks!
