In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. One of my friends recently was hired at a salary 20k more than my own, even though we are at the same level. This caused me to re-think whether or not my company is paying me fairly and planted seeds for making me leave for something better.
   
   So the question is: how does one gauge “average salary” (other than at say for example glass door.com) for one’s city and should I interview for a higher salary and come back and ask for a counter offer? How will I be viewed if I did such a thing?


2. I've been an engineer in the video game industry for 10 years. I've worked for 4 large game studios and at each one the story has been the same. Once it comes time to release our game, the crunch time kicks in.
   
   Often the need to work overtime is implied, but on my current project the company president directly spelled out that ALL engineers would be working a minimum of 60 hours per week for AT LEAST six months. In the past I've chosen to jump ship before it gets that bad, but I really wanna see this project through to the end.
   
   We're all salaried employees and so far we've received no compensation for our overtime hours. No comp time or anything. The only carrot that has been dangled is that ""it will be taken into consideration during bonus time"".
   
   How much is reasonable to expect as a bonus for this much overtime? 10% of my annual salary? 50%? A firm handshake and a swift layoff?
   
   Thanks guys for any advice you can give!
