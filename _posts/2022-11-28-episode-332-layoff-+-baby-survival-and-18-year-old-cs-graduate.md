In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. My company recently had a big layoff - about 40% of engineers are gone. My job is safe (for now). About 6 months ago, I was promoted to  a “Staff”-ish position that I’ve been really enjoying and looks great on my resume if I hold it for a good length of time.
   
   Besides just enjoying my job, I’ve just moved house and I have a baby on the way, so I’m highly motivated to have some stability (and get paid parental leave.)
   
   My gut says give it the 9 months to see how it all plays out - but my brain thinks my gut is an idiot. Interviewing while taking care of a newborn for the first time feels like an incredibly difficult thing to do and the job market may not be getting better.
   
   Do you have any advice for how to navigate this situation?

2. Big fan of the pod!
   How should I approach being slightly younger than my peers at the workplace? I graduate in December with my bachelor's in CS but just turned 18 a couple of months ago. I'm actively interviewing at big tech companies and plan to start working as soon as I graduate. Should I avoid the topic or would it be completely inconsequential for my peers to be aware of my age? I'm looking to move up the ranks quickly, and can imagine many developers wouldn't love knowing their manager is in their early 20s.
   For what it's worth as well, I haven't been open about being slightly younger in my university setting, as early on I noticed professors didn't respect my contributions as much when they were aware of my age. What's your take?
