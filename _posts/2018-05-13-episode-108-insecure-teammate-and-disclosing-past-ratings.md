In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. What do I do about an insecure teammate whose insecurity causes them to lash out at others?
2. I'd like to change teams within my company, but I've had some negative performance reviews in the past. How early should I disclose this to my prospective manager?

Jamison talks about the [Khan Academy Engineering Principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PW4NYn9pYNam2EuGEsTN9pTgwTfFnT_R9OZLJJICWQU/edit#heading=h.wksczgmzufvp), which are great and which you should read.
