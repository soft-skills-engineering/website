In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. Hey Dave and Jamison, really wish I found your podcast sooner as it has been a great insight into some of the challenges at work.
   
   Last year, a fairly close friend reached out asking for a referral for an entry level position to my work. Trying to help him out, I figured absolutely!  What could go wrong? (Foreshadowing intensifies)
   
   About 3 months into his employment, my boss informally mentioned at a dinner how behind said friend was at a technical level.  I brushed this off, and reassured him that he'll catch up.
   
   6 months into his employment said friend was written up a few times for a few different reasons:  tardiness , performance (avoids taking tickets and calls), using phone too often during work hours, fell asleep at his desk.
   
   7 months in brought in our yearly reviews, which he was denied a raise due to his performance history.  He asked me if I thought this was correct, and I was brutally honest with him and agreed with that decision. He didn't take this well, and resulted in an argument between us.  At this point I was pretty frustrated with his performance, and it was definitely straining the relationship.
   
   1 Year in (today), he was caught working on side-projects (paid) at work..... which resulted being put on a PIP / Final Warning.  I got pulled aside by my boss and HR asking if I knew about it, I said I knew he had side work, but I wasn't aware it was being done on company time. He's on the verge of losing his job, but I can't help but feel somewhat responsible for referring him.
   
   All of above events have really hurt the friendship, to the point where I don't think I would call him a friend. I've pulled him aside more than a handful of times asking what's going on, or if I can help him in anyway but either resulted in a small improvement or a stubborn response that he's fine at work.
   
   Am I holding him to too high of a standard?  I don't think the friendship will heal anytime soon, which I am fine with, but am I responsible for referring them?
   
   Thanks for your time guys, love the podcast and advice!


2. I'm currently a manager and applied for a manager role at another company. I heard back from the recruiter that the manager role was filled, but they were still hiring for tech leads.
   
   I really want to work at this company, so I asked to interview for a tech lead role. But I really want to be a manager. I'm tempted to ask if they'd be willing to then interview me as if I were a candidate for the manager position I originally applied for.
   
   Should I try to show them my readiness for a manager role (even though they no longer have a manager role available) just so I can be top of mind when a manager role opens up? Or should I just be happy falling back into the tech lead ranks and try to prove myself over time?
   
   I really don't mind starting out in the tech lead role and moving back up to management when I'm settled in at the company and an opportunity presents itself, but I can't help but wonder if I could have passed the bar for the manager role I originally applied for.
