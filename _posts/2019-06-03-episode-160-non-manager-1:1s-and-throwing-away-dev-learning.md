In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Is it weird to have 1-1s but not with my ‘manager’?
   
   Management is planning to start holding ‘1-1s’ every 6-8 weeks for the development team.
   
   The purpose of these 1-1s: ~ 'So you can talk about non-technical things, any issues with the team or things that are making you unhappy.' But these 1-1s be with someone who is nominally ‘HR’, not our manager. Since it’s a tiny company, their responsibilities cover things like accounting and sales support.
   
   This person doesn’t have any people management or software product development experience, nor any experience in our product domain, and won’t really be our ‘manager’ going forward.
   
   Maybe I should just 🎶 quit my job 🎶 🕺. Then I'll have new and unfamiliar problems to worry about 😅
   


2. Hello Jamison and Dave, I have a question on career progression, tech skills and moving into a new role.
   
   I'm a career switcher who has spent the last four years studying to move into a developer role.
   
   Over the last year I've been working on a technical project that has been delivered on time, under budget and ahead of schedule, a huge win for me and the team.  However, now that it's done my manager's manager is looking at how the team is structured and who we need to hire.
   
   He has come to me and my manager to ask if I would like to move in to more of a Project Manager / Business Analyst role as I have done such a good job of the project roll out this year.
   
   I'm good at that kind of work, I do get a kick out of it, but if I don't push forward to move into a developer role have I wasted the last four years retraining?  Should I take the role and continue to push to be a full time developer on the team, or accept my fate but use the skills I've gained to be a better BA?
