In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. Zach asks,
   
   A few weeks ago, I interviewed and recommended we hire a contractor candidate, who I will call "Bob". We hired "Bob". Today was the first time I saw "Bob" since the interview, only "Bob" was not the person I interviewed. It seems "Bob" had someone else pretend to be him to pass the interview. What should I do?


2. Thank you for doing this show, it's amazing and I look forward to listen to it every week. I'm a software engineer with 3.5 years of experience and in those years I've worked at 5 different companies consecutively, increasing my salary by around 50~70% every time I change jobs. At this point I'm afraid that it looks really bad in my resume since the longest that I've been at one company is 1 year and 3 months but at the same time it is really tempting to keep growing my salary and benefits that easily. Does changing jobs every ~1 year have a negative effect on my employability in the long run?
