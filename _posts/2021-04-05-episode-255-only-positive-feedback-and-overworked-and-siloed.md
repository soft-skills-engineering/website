In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. Hey there! Thank you so much for the amazing podcast.
   
   In my current job I work with an incredible (and very strong technically) team, and I like working with my manager a lot. BUT, during all 1:1s, and annual reviews the feedback is always that I am doing a great job and there is never a negative nor constructive criticism. However, I have been waiting for a promotion for more than a year, I never get assigned to the shinier and more challenging tasks/projects, and for the merit review I was put in the "good" bucket (not great, not the best).
   
   So, if I am always doing a great job, what else can I do to get this promotion and be trust worthy of shining projects?


2. Jon asks,
   
   I’m having a hard time at work. There is so much to do my team can barely spare the time to collaborate on anything. Even when I ask for help, the overwhelming stress usually results in a snarky response.
   
   I’ve been working here for a year under these conditions and I’ve learned a lot but we never talk to each other...I feel like I still don’t have the whole picture because I’ve basically never been onboarded. I want to collaborate with my team but either the organizational structure or sheer amount of work is keeping us in silos. Trying to break them down usually lands me in the dog house.
   
   What the heck do I do now? I feel like if I stay I’ll only ever get year 1 dev experience, but I also feel like I’ll be totally useless to any real development team.
