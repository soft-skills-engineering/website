In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. Quite often my manager writes me in the morning: hey, can you help the team with this thing? And sometimes it happens so that I know no more than "the team" about the thing, and actually there's no way in the world I can help them, but everyone assumes that I am some kind of expert in it. Where did they get that impression? This is so irritating!
   
   I absolutely love to be asked for help when what I'm asked for is kind of "my thing".
   
   But in some cases, I can't just say "hey, this is not really my specialty, I will be more of a burden here", because everyone would think that I'm just lazy or unwilling to help. And then I sit and struggle through the process of everyone asking me questions I obviously don't know answers to, and I try to guess or figure out these answers, and I suffer because I don't meet everyone else's expectations, and everyone else suffers because no one knows what to do, and it goes on and on and on...
   I don't know about you - do you find yourself in such situations and what do you do if you do?


2. My company just asked me if I'm interested in going to a conference that's about a month away, but I'm currently in the process of job hunting and don't know if I'm going to be around for much longer than a month. What do I do?
   It feels dishonest to go and then leave the company shortly after. But it also feels dishonest to say "Nope! Not interested!" because I actually would like to go. There's also the benefit that people often are recruiting at conferences so it might be a great place to be for that.
