In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I've been wondering what kind of career conversations happen between managers and the "max-level" engineers on the team. We've all been on a team with those really good staff/principal engineers who are super nice, have great people skills, and seem to have an answer for every technical problem. When I'm asked to peer review some of these people, I basically have nothing to say because they seem perfect. Yet even as individual contributors, they have the same manager and still have the same 1 on 1s with them. What exactly do they talk about? How are their career conversations held? I'm always curious what exactly the landscape looks like for these engineers and what exactly is "next" for them since they seem to have reached the level cap.

2. Hello peeps, I'm an engineering leader in a midsized company. I oversee a couple of teams and things in general have been going well. However:
   
   One of the teams tackles an extremely complex problem space and is usually up to the task, delivering things that almost seem like magic if you take a closer look. Now, due to the nature of this team's work the value is not perceived as such by upper management, being questioned (almost pestered) if this is the right thing to do and even doubting if the resources should be allocated to it at all. The way that I see it is, that since this team has been quietly delivering greatness (delivering quality, meeting deadlines, not breaking things), there are not perceived as hero's (like other teams would when then put out their, sometimes, auto inflicted fires).
   
   What can the team do to rise awareness about the criticality and impact of their work? This is important so that the team can have resources and doesn't get pulled away from their current work. Also, is this a good time to quit my job while we are waiting for the AI bubble to burst?
   
   (Disclaimer, I've found an approach and am currently enacting it, but wanted to hear your thoughts on the matter)
