It's our first RAPID FIRE episode, where we answer a bunch of questions rapid-ish-ly.

1. Why do I get passed up for developer jobs?
2. Should I take this high-paying job even though it's a scary change?
3. Should I quit my first job after five years?

We also answer a longer question:

How do I deal with a micromanaging project manager?
