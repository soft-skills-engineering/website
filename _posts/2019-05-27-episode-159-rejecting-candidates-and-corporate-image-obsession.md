In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I'm a hiring manager and sometimes have to say no to candidates who interview with us. How do I reject them kindly?


2. In my current company, they only care about reputation of the company. They don't care about their employees or values, they prefer to invest in other things. One time the CEO asked everyone in the company to create fake accounts in order to vote for the company for an Award. By the way, we received the award. But  I don't know how to feel about this company non-existing values.
