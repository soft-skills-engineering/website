In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. I'm a developer responsible for hiring other developers for my company. I'm comfortable interviewing and I feel like I can get a good grasp on whether the interviewee is technically competent.
   
   My boss wants us to give a take-home technical test to people after the first interview if we're happy with how they interviewed and want to proceed further.
   
   The current technical test is time-boxed and is designed to represent the work they would do at our company. I worry that we ask for too many requirements within the current time constraint of 2 hours, but asking for more time will put people off completely.
   
   What can we do to make sure the technical test is fair and a good experience for candidates?


2. Hello Dave and Jamison,
   
   I am a team lead at a rapidly expanding company. We have been trying to fill open head counts (>4) for over a year now, and our team is also handed some very important and promising projects, and because of that, even more open reqs for our team. Recently in our 1:1, I was pressing my manager to fill the openings ASAP but he told me our company recruiters are so busy that our team don't have any dedicated recruiters, and my manager have been sourcing candidates himself for almost a year now.
   
   I was surprised by that and offered to help. I had read some materials from the recruiting team, got the tools set up and ready to cold email people I found on LinkedIn. My question is, how do I approach them in an authentic manner? I am proud of my company and our products, but how do I reach out to them without letting them know my primary motivation is get more team members to do the work so I can get more sleep? On the other side of the table, I feel those recruiting emails are cold and a waste of my time. So looking at the funnel I built, I don't know if I can bring myself to start spamming others' inbox.
