In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. On Episode 66 you attempted to answer my question: 'How bad can a Junior Front End Developer be?' Well, I'm now 4 months into my new job as a Junior Front End Developer and it turns out, they can be pretty bad!
   
   I'm in this junior role I feel overqualified for. My peers rate me as a solid mid-level, and I've started to realize that I'm not really a "junior". I think this can all be attributed to learning from really good devs at my last company. My best friend is a Senior JS Contractor (legend) and I talk to him about code and best practices everyday.
   
   *Question*:
   Would you ever hire someone at a mid-level role even if they only had 6 months of profressional experience? i.e. how much weight do you put on the CV?
   
   I love you guys, listened to every podcast!


2. Thank you so much for the show, I've been binge listening to old episodes ever since a friend of mine suggested it. Your excellent, and often comedic, advice has been getting me through the work day and I really appreciate it! Onward to the question!
   
   One of the members on my team, who is more senior than me, often does poor work, and the rest of the team picks up the slack to redo the work, pushing out deadlines we would have otherwise met. I know better than to vent about this at work even though it is very frustrating, however now I'm in a bit of a predicament. Part of our annual review process requires us to provide feedback on each of the members of our team which is not anonymous. The feedback is used to make decisions about raises and promotions. This individual has mentioned that they expect a promotion to a team lead position in this upcoming review cycle, which makes me quite nervous. Should I be honest in my review and mention my concerns or should I take the much more comfortable route that will also protect relationships on my team of pretending everything is fine.
