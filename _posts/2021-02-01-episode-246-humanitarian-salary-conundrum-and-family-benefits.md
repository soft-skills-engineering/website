In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. I listen to the show while I'm working out and wanted you to know I've almost dropped the weight on myself multiple times when one of you cracks a funny joke (which is often, I'm learning to be more careful)😂.
   
   I work for a growing startup as a dev manager. Hiring has proven to be one of our most difficult challenges. We had one candidate in particular that would qualify as a potentially "Risky" since they lacked experience in our industry. We ended up hiring them because their salary requirements were so low, they were half of what we pay other junior engineers. They quickly proved be miles above the Junior engineer position. They have strong technical skills, are proactive with resolving problems, and have raised the bar for the entire dev organization. They currently meet all the criteria for what we would qualify as a Senior engineer at our company.
   
   I've started feeling uncomfortable about how little we are paying this person. I've brought this concern up with management, but their take is that if they asked for the little amount that they did, then we should leave them at that for as long as they are comfortable there. The part that takes this to a whole new level of humanitarian concern for me is that, in passing, I found out that this person is trying to get approval for adoption and that is why they had to leave their consulting background and settle for a salary job. I'm familiar with the adoption process and if we were paying them what they were actually worth (or even 25% closer to what that number is) the entire process would be different for them. I want to take care of the company, but I also believe that we should pay people what they are worth.  What should I do?


2. I've recently joined a new company (hoorah!) and even more exciting, I'm engaged (double hoorah)! Previously, I've focused heavily on my career progression and decided what a good job for me was based on my selfish reasons (more pay). Now, my priorities are shifting towards family first and I've been looking into any parental benefits the company may offer (unfortunately none).
   
   Is it worth looking around for a company that will provide better parental leave benefits and child-care days?
