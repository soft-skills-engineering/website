It's one more re-run before we are back with new stuff! Enjoy this episode from November 2018, back when Tiger King didn't yet exist.

In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. I sit in a desk with 3 other people. One of those people does a great job of personal hygiene...the other two not so much. I have dropped a couple of hints about it (I mentioned it is a good idea not to wear the same pair shoes/trainers every day so you're feet don't start to smell).
   Some days, my stomach will churn from the smells that inevitably waft over.
   What should I do - I am worried if I tell my boss to talk to them, he will mark me as a troublemaker/overly sensitive.

   To make things worse, one of them sits opposite and puts his feet under my desk, so the, let's be frank, absolutely awful stench is *right* under my nose! :?

   It's not just feet by the way, we are talking the full BO experience.


2. I was at a interview recently. When being asked for expected salary. I mentioned a number lot more than what the company was expecting. It‚Äôs already been a week and I haven‚Äôt received a response from them. I really really love the company and the project they are working on. I would love to to contact the HR personal and tell that I am interested in the position even if it means less money. How do I approach the situation? I don‚Äôt want to mess it up more than I already have. üôÅ
