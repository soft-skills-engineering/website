This is a rerun of episode 220.

In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. Hello,
   
   I know you said you don't read the compliments on air most of the time but this podcast is great. I just found it a few weeks ago and I love the positive fun approach to question answering. It has really made me think about software engineering outside of the ""make code do thing"" box.
   
   Anyway, the question: I have been at the same company for 4 years. It is my first job out of college. I have ended up working in so many different languages and frameworks I don't remember them all. I guess that's just how things go. Recently I have been selected to take on a scrum master role and I feel I am quickly being groomed for management.
   
   That was never really my goal. I wanted to build a depth of knowledge and always have my hands on code.
   
   Will taking on these kind of roles hurt my chances at future technical roles? Am I dooming myself to managing spreadsheets and Jira tickets until I retire? Will I only communicate in Dilbert references?


2. My teammate frequently gives status updates or fields follow up questions about work that was mostly done by someone else. I am pretty sure they do this to be helpful not to claim credit for all the work. I just wish I could speak up about the work I contributed primarily to before they do so on my behalf. I wish it didn't bother me since we are one team and I would rather focus on the progress of the team rather than receiving credit.
   
   How should I respond to these situations in a way that allows me to not get bothered emotionally and also do what's best for the team?
