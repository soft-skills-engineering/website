In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I keep getting asked to interview new candidates. But my interview feedback history is pretty bad. I've said yes to hiring:
   
   * Someone who's super smart, but drives me absolutely crazy with constant argument and may cause me to take the time-honored Soft Skills advice and quit my job.
   * My boss at my former company, who DID drive me to quit my job.
   * My first (and only) hire back when I was a people manager, who turned out to be terrible, but I was told I had to keep him around because "it would look bad" to fire my first hire.
   
   What should I do? Is it acceptable to just keep turning down interview requests? I've wandered into a tech lead position, so I suspect I can't dodge them forever. But I don't want to keep suggesting bad hires just for the sake of getting more interview practice.
   
   Thanks for all the advice and the laughs! I've been a regular listener for a couple years.


2. How long do I need to wait before bailing on a new job I don't like? More than a month? It's not totally miserable: the people are nice and the company has good prospects. But the technical decisions of the team lead to daily frustrations for me.
