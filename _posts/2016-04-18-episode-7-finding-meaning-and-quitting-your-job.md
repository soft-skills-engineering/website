In episode 7, Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

How do I quit my job? What's the process? How do I avoid burning bridges? What will my employer expect from me? How do benefits work?

I'm worried my job is not meaningful? Am I just cranking out code for "the man"? What can I do to get more meaning out of my job?
