In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I work in a flat organization. There aren't really any titles, and very few managers.  There is no common "climbing the ladder" here. What are options for career growth that will help me feel confident that I am progressing in my career?


2. How do references work?  I’m starting to look for a new job which means potential employers are going to be asking me for references.  I’m not ready to let my boss know I’m thinking of leaving and aside from my current coworkers I don’t know who would attest to my ability as an engineer. I work for a small company (under 50) in an even smaller firmware department (about half a dozen).  What am I to do?
