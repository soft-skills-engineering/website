[Dave](https://twitter.com/djsmith42) and [Jamison](https://twitter.com/jamison_dance) answer these questions:

1. I've been a software engineer for 13 years and would like to apply for a management role. I've never managed before. How do I apply for a job as a manager without managerial experience?
2. How do I deal with annoying noises around my desk? One neighbor listens to loud music. Another one pops the bubbles on his bubblewrap (to calm himself obviously but also infuriate me). Please help =)
