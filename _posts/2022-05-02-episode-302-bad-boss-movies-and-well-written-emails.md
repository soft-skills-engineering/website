In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. My boss keeps recommending bad movies. I watch most of them but I feel bad because they're not good and I don't want to disappoint my boss. They are 'okay' but are really mediocre. Do I just ignore my boss's suggestions or should I keep watching these terrible action-heist movies even though I don't like them?

2. Does it matter if my emails are well written?
   
   I'm a software engineer. I asked my partner how I should word a part of my email. After reading my email they were appalled. They said that it was "abysmally written and lacked refinement". I'll admit that it wasn't my best written email, but who cares? It was just an email letting a team member know that I had followed up on a ticket a while ago, so it wasn't like this was going to a client or something. Plus I felt like the email conveyed the message that it needed to.
   
   In my mind as long as the email isn't offensive or covered in grammatical errors and conveys the message, isn't that good enough? My partner argued that I should write my emails more eloquently since my "terrible" emails will reflect poorly on me. I told other engineers care more about the content and less about how well-written any given email is, but they wouldn't budge. In addition to that, some of the emails I've gotten from our senior and staff engineers seem like they were written with someone who has the English skills of a middle schooler and they seem to do fine for themselves.
   
   Thoughts?
