In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. My boss is fairly new to management and has recently made some decisions which had a negative impact on my squad. While this was annoying, it didn't cause any major problems - we worked around the issues and recovered and everyone including my boss learned from the experience. However, my squad has started criticising him pretty harshly in standups and retrospectives and it's making me really uncomfortable. Often their criticisms are for things that he has very little influence over and it seems like they're scapegoating him for the general dysfunction within the company. He's a nice guy who is trying his best and I wouldn't want him to think I'm taking part in these badmouthing sessions if word ever gets back to him. He doesn't manage any of the other squad members. What should I do?


2. I work at a big software company and sit in a room with about 20 people. Not all of them are on my project, and lots of them are REALLY loud. You know like in a stock market or something.
   I use headphones to listen to your podcast (well, not only yours to be honest) but usually that's no help. I turn on music - still can hear every word. These guys somehow think it's ok to discuss their work in our room instead of a meeting room (which we have plenty of), and do it loudly, while me and my team always go somewhere else to talk.
   
   I talked to these guys a couple of times about it. They laughed and said they would try to be a little bit more quiet, but forgot this promise 5 minutes later.
   How else can I handle this situation? I have good relationships with all of them (probably that's why I had not been taken seriously), but I don't want to lose them.
