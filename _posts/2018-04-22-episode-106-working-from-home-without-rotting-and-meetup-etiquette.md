[Dave](https://twitter.com/djsmith42) and [Jamison](https://twitter.com/jamison_dance) answer these questions:

1. Since working remotely I've noticed a trend to do things like not leaving the house, growing my beard out to above average length, or not wearing (real) pants. What should I do to keep from losing any/all interpersonal skills?
2. Is there such a thing as meetup etiquette? When I attend meetups and attempt to initiate conversion with people, I'm hesitant to interrupt people who are in discussion with others. Should I wait, try to join the discussion or just barge in on the conversion?
