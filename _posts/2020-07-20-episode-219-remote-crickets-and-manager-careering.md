In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. I took the cult's advice and quit my job at a start-up!! Now I'm at a big company and the pace of work is REAL different.
   
   In my previous life, if I asked a question, I would get an answer within the minute, or at the most, within the hour.
   
   At my new gig, the response time on Slack can be 6 hours, and pull request comments so far are never -- after a day has passed, I just send a Slack to ask for a response to the PR comment. I've noticed that if I schedule a Zoom call I have the best chance of getting a hold of them, but a video call sometimes feels like overkill.
   
   I realize it's due to my coworkers/manager being super busy, so I try to make my questions short, sweet and infrequent.
   
   Still, I'm now missing deadlines because I can't get an answer. How can I get my coworkers' attention so I can do my work and meet my deadlines?


2. Engineering Managers support growth of their direct reports. Once you become a manager, it's expected to own your own career development. How much should you expect your manager to support you in that?
