This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. My boss wants me to speak at conferences, but I'm very new to software. What should I do?
2. How do I get more than a 2% raise? That is the company average.

We talked about conferences a bit more way back in [episode 6](https://softskills.audio/2016/04/11/episode-6-speaking-at-conferences/).

We also talked more about playing the salary game in [episode 23](https://softskills.audio/2016/08/22/episode-23-cto-questions-and-getting-a-raise/), which is a technique for sharing salary information with your co-workers.
