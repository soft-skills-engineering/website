In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Listener Sara asks,
   
   How can I deal with favoritism towards informal leaders in a group? The group is losing group intelligence because the informal leader's reasoning and direction is favored. Example: when member A propose an argument is dismissed, but when the informal leader proposes the same argument it is cherished.

2. How do I react to the question "why didn't you do it this way" for features already in production? I am frustrated by being asked that. I got scolded for an idea that turned out to be bad after I implemented it (in production), although I asked the Lead for his opinion ahead of time. As soon as trouble came up a.k.a performance issue in production, he pointed the finger at me. Lost all kinds of respect for him.
