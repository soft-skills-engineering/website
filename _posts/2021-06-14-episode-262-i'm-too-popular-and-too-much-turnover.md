In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. Hello!! This is maybe the opposite of a problem, but I‚Äôve found myself stuck - how do you navigate too much interest from outside parties? I work in a pretty niche subsection of software dev, so I field a lot of job offers/recruitment when people start to put together a new team. These are usually coming from managers/people I would be working with directly (and admire!) rather than recruiters. Generally the opportunities are something I could see myself doing _one day_, but I‚Äôm perfectly content in my role as-is for the time being. Where‚Äôs the line between expressing interest in future opportunities (emphasis on future) without stringing people along? How many ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù conversations are reasonable before it shifts from maintaining a relationship to active recruiting? Apologies if this comes across as a humble brag but I‚Äôm getting overwhelmed. Love the show, you rock ü§ò
   


2. I recently started a new position at a startup after being recruited by one of their senior leaders. Being a startup the company has had its ups and downs, including some layoffs within the last year. I am really loving the company so far, the people, the culture. They really seem to care about correcting past mistakes and listening to feedback from everyone. There is still a good amount of turnover among engineers and engineering managers. I‚Äôm sure some turnover is normal especially at startup. But at what point does it really become something I need to be concerned about? What questions should/can I ask to help me get a better picture of what is going on? Is there anything specific I should look out for that might be my cue to start creating a backup plan?
