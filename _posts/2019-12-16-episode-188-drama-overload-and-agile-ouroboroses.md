In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I work in a charity as an iOS developer and there is so much drama in the office about anything. I am so scared to talk with my backend engineer about work that we created a non-company slack workspace. This is how we communicate, even though we sit right next to each other. Please send help.


2. I work in a company that's around 10 years old with 1800 employees that started implementing agile methodologies a few years ago. It was great and improved the work, but now all the agile coaches are pushing to have physical boards and doing things apparently just to justify their own existence. I agree we all should try new methodologies but shouldn't it always be based on a problem we are trying to solve? And shouldn't all the team be on board with the change instead of just doing it because the agile coach wants to?
