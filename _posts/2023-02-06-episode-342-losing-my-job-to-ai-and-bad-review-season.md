In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hello Dave and Jamison, thanks for your great work. Your podcast has the bizarre magical property of making me look forward to long drives. Keep it up!
   
   I have been feeling anxiety over losing my job to AI, especially after the all the ChatGPT stuff from a few months back. I know that it definitely isn't flawless but I know that this technology will just keep improving as time goes on.
   
   I am a software engineer with 2 years of experience. I can't help but feeling like I will lose this amazing career in the near future. I left my old line of work a couple years back and am in my mid 30s, so switcyhing careers again is a dreadful thought.
   
   Is there anything you can suggest to ease my anxiety? Will being more social with my coworkers, or aiming towards management help reduce my chances of being automated? Any advice will be great, thanks.
   
   PS: If someone tries to replace your podcast with an AI generated one I will boycott them and stick with you.

2. It's review season! I am an IC software engineer, and I am required to document my impact for the last year.
   However, I work on an auxiliary team/new business team that is always trying to find new use cases for the existing product platform. If you look at the numbers, the impact is very low compared to the core business. Also, my team was disproportionally impacted by layoffs late last year. Lot of folks with institutional knowledge and good relationships with the core team were let go which disrupted our team and contributed to missed deadlines.
   How do I write my review for this bad year, with little to show for it?
