In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Morning! I will cut straight to the chase: I'm burned out and tired. At the same time, I'm aiming to get a promotion during the next cycle. My manager is aware of the latter, but not the former. Should I tell them? I suspect that I would get a lighter work load and less responsibilities, but it might also impact my chances at getting a promotion. The project I'm working is a "high stakes, tight deadlines" mess. I usually would just take a week or two of PTO, but the tight deadlines make it hard. Do I grin and bear it till promotion cycle (another 4-6 months) or just tell my manager and risk losing the rewards?

2. I'm about to get promoted to L6, what my company calls Lead Engineer, but I have to move to another team for it to happen. The other team already has a few people who are applying for that same promotion, and they got skipped over for my promo. They've also been devs longer than me. (4 years for me) So, I'm worried about tension on that team when I join.
   
   On top of that, I'll be learning this role too! How can I make room for myself to have failures and make poor decisions, while also not undermining my expertise? How can I step into this lead role while not stepping on the toes of the engineers already on the team?
   
   Any tips for someone leading a team for the first time, while also joining that team?
