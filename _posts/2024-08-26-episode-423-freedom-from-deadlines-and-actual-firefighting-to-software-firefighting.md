In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Thank you hosting this show. This show has given me a lot of insight on nuisances of engineering that isn't mentioned anywhere. Having some experience in industry for a while, I always find in this position where I want some autonomy but I am bounded by the deadline. What do you think should be the way to start a career that gives autonomy while having that sweet benefits from the industry?

2. I used to be a senior manager of an operations team for a fire fighting service in Australia. I managed all of our physical operational assets - for example radio towers, mobile communications e.g. 5g, 4g technologies, mobile data terminals e.g. laptops in fire fighting appliances "fire trucks ;) ", data centers, networking so on...
   
   A restructuring means my team has grown to include in-house software development. While i am excited for this opportunity and on board with the changes, it is a very big shift from the physical and electrical engineering side to software development.
   
   The C level staff thinks the team lacks focus and there are "problems" to address.
   
   I have been meeting the new team and working through the changes. They are very nervous and are skeptical about how Iâ€™ll understand their world, which is fair.
   
   How can I best support this team? What are cultural things I should be aware of? What are key metrics I can measure that will fairly represent their hard work to the executive team? Any thoughts on what things a manager or managers can do to be supportive as the new drop in from across the room from a entirely different engineering discipline? Coding in my world is scripting and hacking about to make things work (telecommunication engineer)
