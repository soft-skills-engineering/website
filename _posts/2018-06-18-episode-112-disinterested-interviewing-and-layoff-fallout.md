In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Is it common for developers to take an interview without real interest in a job?

   Is it common for a company to reject a candidate because they think candidate is not interested in a job?

   Recently I had an interview and I was rejected even though I though it went really well. From internal channels in that company I learned that the interviewer thought I wasn't really searching for a new job and was just doing interviews for fun or to improve my skills. That was really frustrating. And also, well, flattering. But still, I don't understand what signals I may have given. I asked questions about the company, processes, etc. I prepared really well. And I asked for a salary that's quite significant for our market.

   The only reason I see is that I always worked remotely and this is position in an office.

   By the way, LOVE your show!

2. What happens when a wave of engineers leaves your company?

   I work for a startup that went through a brutal round of layoffs, before stabilizing. We're building the engineering team back up, but the core team members that built our platform are gone.

   How do we approach maintaining things, adding new things, technology decisions, etc?
