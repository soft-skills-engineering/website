In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I have a job I mostly enjoy, with a super flexible schedule and the freedom to work from anywhere. I learn a lot, and the engineers here are top-notch. However… the pay is only ok, no bonuses, and the stock options feel like a bit of a scam. Asking for a raise isn’t really an option since the company doesn’t have much money. We’ve even cut back on perks, and our yearly kickoff was postponed due to financial issues. I don’t think we’ll go bankrupt, but things will be tight for a while. It’s an exciting, futuristic company, but... there are other exciting companies that pay more and toss in a free hoodie now and then. Should I start looking for a new job?

2. Hey there! Love the podcast and the advice you give!
   
   After a year of managing of an engineering team, I asked to step back to IC. I was asked to continue working on the team I was previously managing, but this time as a senior engineer.
   
   I'm worried about the transition. I know a lot of how the leadership works for good and for ill, I hired some of my peers, and I know everyone's comp and more.
   
   I want to be a peer on the team after having been their manager. What advice can you give to help me become their peer?
   
   Thanks in advance and keep up the incredible episodes with your extremely beautiful voices.
