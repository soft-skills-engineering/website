In episode 19, Jamison and  Dave answer these questions:

Would you ever fire someone over a coding mistake? For example, should you empathize with ignorance and explain how SQL injection works or is the mistake so basic as to be intolerable. Would you change your answer if the mistake was found during a code review or found as the source of a data breach?

How do you positively represent the desire to be demoted? I am called a 'senior engineer', but I got that way because of null instead of actual skill. I would like to be a senior engineer at some point, but I would be a better one if I travel more where I have seniors to look up to, established processes etc rather than stressing about defining everything myself; but that's a weird thing to say to a current or potential boss and is hard to do without also volunteering for a pay cut.
