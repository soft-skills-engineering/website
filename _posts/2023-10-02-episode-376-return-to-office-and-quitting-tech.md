In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I applied and was hired for a 100% telecommute position. Recently, the company has mandated all employees near an office switch to a hybrid schedule. I'm looking at an hour or more round trip and the yearly cost of parking is several thousand dollars. The company also announced to their investors that massive layoffs will be coming due to the economy and redundancies due to a large merger.
   
   I'm relatively new to the company and left my previous company after only a couple of years. I like where I work and the company benefits. I do prefer working in office and don't want to be seen as a perpetual job hopper. I'm just not thrilled about the commute time and commute paycut.
   
   We have been assured my product is invaluable but should I believe that? A friend referred me to a hybrid position biking distance from my house. Assuming I'm made an offer, should I take it? What if it's slightly less than what I'm making now?

2. Hi Jamison and Dave, another long time listener here. Thank you for all your advice and the good laughs you provide in the show!
   
   I'm in my early 40s and have been working since I was 19 with a few years spent in education at university. In all these years there have been ups and downs, financial crises, personal crises, layoffs, good laughs and friendships, great teams, projects and bosses, and not so great teams, projects and bosses. I have enjoyed some of the work I've been doing in my industry, and I've enjoyed making some good contributions to my field.
   
   I have been badly burned out two times in my career. Healing and recovering was hard but thankfully I was able to rejoin the workforce successfully (or that's what I thought). Last year I identified I'm slowly burning out badly again. Since this will be my third time, I'm \*very\* seriously reconsidering a career change, to quit tech and software altogether. I'm passionate about the field I work in though it seems I can't avoid getting sick badly from time to time in part because of the difficulties for finding a good team/project fit, having to deal with difficult people at work and a mental health condition I've been struggling with since my teens.
   
   I have friends in the industry that are very senior, and we all share common struggles and our complaints about the industry are getting worse and worse with time. Is that a symptom of becoming more experienced? Are we all becoming jaded?
   
   My current job pays well, but I've come to the realisation that it isn't a good deal to trade great compensation for my health. I'm seriously considering downshifting and quitting tech to hopefully (and finally) bring sanity and peace to my life. This is something I've been also discussing with my therapist lately. So here's my question: do you think it's worth pursuing a long career in tech, or it's just that the more experienced and senior you become the hardest the job becomes because your awareness raises? Do you have any other advice?
   
   Thanks for reading and congrats again on the podcast!
