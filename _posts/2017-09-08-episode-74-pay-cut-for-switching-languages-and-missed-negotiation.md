Jamison and Dave will be at the UtahJS Conference on September 18th. See [conf.utahjs.com](https://conf.utahjs.com) for more info and to buy tickets. Come say hi!

This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. Do I need to take a pay cut when switching languages?
2. I was promoted at work but didn't get a raise or a title change. What do I do?
