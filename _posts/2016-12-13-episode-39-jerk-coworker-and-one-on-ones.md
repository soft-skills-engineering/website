In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. How do I deal with engineers who are skilled technically but rude and demeaning?
2. What should I talk about in one on ones with my manager or reports? We also cite [Questions for our first 1:1](http://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/), a blog post by Lara Hogan.
