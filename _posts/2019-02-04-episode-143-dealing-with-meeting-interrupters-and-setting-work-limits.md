In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I have noticed one of my coworkers, a fellow senior software engineer, often interrupts people during their meetings with his comments and thoughts.
   
   While I'm not against voicing opinions during a meeting, he does it so often that he takes over meetings. Some of his points are off-topic. He'll cut off the presenter or another colleague (who displayed good etiquette) mid-sentence, not letting them finish their thought and derailing the flow of the meeting.
   
   In our last meeting I tried to quickly respond to his interjections rather than let him finish so we can keep the meeting moving. I thought he would take the hint to think a little more before interrupting. Ineffective so far. I think next time I will recommend that all questions and concerns be held to the end so we can get through all the meaningful content before letting him speak. Any other suggestions on how to deal with people like this?


2. Hi guys! I have a question about setting limits to your work.
   I hear that its a common practice among developers to set restrictions to their work like turning off slack notifications when at home, not staying late at work, etc. This seems like a healthy approach, and I like it.
   
   But I can't bring myself to do it.
   
   I'm a successful developer, I love my job, and I love the work communication in our chat. I have no problems struggling through the workday, but I have problems not falling into work in my free time.
   
   I have a lot of friends, a lot of hobbies, I'm definitely not bored outside of work. But still I always have this inner desire to open and read the workchat when I have a free minute, or finish an interesting feature in the evening instead of reading an interesting book.
   
   I can't say it makes me unhappy in some way or affects my private life - I still will go and see a friend if I'm invited and still will attend my yoga class on a normal schedule - but this ""desire"" distracts me sometimes and that's not normal either. Am I right?
