In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hi Dave and Jamison, love the show and your advice, there's no podcast quite like yours out there in the audiosphere.
   
   I'm a long time listener, first time question asker.
   
   "I've been doing a really good job lately.  I've had feedback from my manager and my managers-manager that I've exceeded expectations and gone above and beyond over the last year.  While the compliments are great to hear, I'd like to approach my manager about a raise to go along with it. Do I wait until performance review time in three months and hope that I get a what I'm hoping for, or bring it up now? How do I approach this conversation without sounding greedy, braggy and potentially asking for too much, leaving a bad impression when I'm on such a roll?


2. I don't feel like I can keep up at work, üò¨, my team is super clever, young and all singles. They spend weekends, evenings and spare time learning. We are introducing a new tool or framework every couple weeks and it is exhausting. I am constantly learning a lot from them and the projects always go really well. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - I'm not sure how to have a good conversation about it as they all love the learning culture. Any tips?
