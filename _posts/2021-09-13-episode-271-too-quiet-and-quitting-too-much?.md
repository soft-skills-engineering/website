In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. Listener Lisa asks,
   
   Hi Dave and Jamison! How do you answer the statement "You're very quiet. Like really quiet"? Me? I tend to give a small smile or recently, I said "I know."
   
   I'm a software developer in a large defense company and I'm on my third and final year of my rotational program. I just rotated back to the same area as my first rotation, so I know a couple of folks. However, I'm not SUPER close to these people. My team is fairly new, but most of the members started at the same time, unlike me, who started just three weeks ago. I want to try to know people and get close to them, but at the same time I know my energy lowers after a couple interactions. I have always been known to be quiet, but I don't want to be known as the odd developer out on my team. The team seems to already know and like each other. I still talk, but only when I have things to say. I tend to stick to doing actually work, while others walk around and talk to people. Especially in the environment I work in, I assumed that we should limit ourselves to mostly chargeable time because we would have to make up the time we spent talking about unrelated work topics. It also doesn't help that most of my team sit around each other, while I'm in a separate area. I think it would just be awkward for me to stand over their area just to talk, then having to make up that time later on.
   
   Should I just accept that I'm mostly an introvert even though I want to belong/to be part of the team? I feel like I want to talk to everyone, but at the same time I sometimes can't relate to what they're talking about or I'm just not interested in some of their topics.
   
   Aside: I feel like there's a lot of extroverted developers here and it's different from what I'm used to.


2. Hiya! I haven't listened too all your episodes, but out of the ones I've heard, it seems like you both suggest quitting our jobs. How many jobs have you quit? My dad had told me a couple years ago (when I was looking for a job) is that if you quit too many times, potential employers would think that you aren't committed or are only looking to get more money. Is this the case? Will companies think that if I quit multiple times?
