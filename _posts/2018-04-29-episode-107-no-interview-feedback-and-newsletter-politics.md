[Dave](https://twitter.com/djsmith42) and [Jamison](https://twitter.com/jergason) answer these questions:

1. I recently interviewed for a role I was very interested in. I didn't get the job,and despite several attempts, didn't receive any feedback on what I could have done differently. I still really want to work there at some point in the future, but have I taken it too far? Have I accidentally burned all of the bridges before I set foot on them?
2. I am a lowly SSE that recently started a tech newsletter at my company. One of the senior VPs (let's call them "E") sent out an email to the org asking people to reply to a newsletter survey so that their team can be featured. A senior manager ("K"), was upset his team wasn't featured but I informed him that he didn't reply to the original survey.
I explained to "K" that he can still send me information for the next issue. "K" then replied back with something very condescending and has now made the newsletter a political device. How should I proceed from here?
