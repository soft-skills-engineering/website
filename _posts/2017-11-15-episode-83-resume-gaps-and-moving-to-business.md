This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. I think I've saved enough money to get out of the rat race. If something goes wrong and I need to get a job again, how do I explain a long gap in my resume?
2. I like writing code but I'm interested in moving to a more business-focused role. How can I test this without burning bridges? Do I need to take a pay cut?
