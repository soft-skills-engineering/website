In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. A few years ago my team chose a niche SPA framework (Aurelia) for the front-end of a large multi-year new product development.
   
   The team started a new product in the same family. I chose to continue using Aurelia. However, some of the developers on the team have suggested using React - newer framework, easier to hire/retain for, etc.
   
   I personally feel that focusing on solid foundational css/html/javascript skills is more important than the actual front-end framework used, but perhaps they have a good point when it comes to retention and hiring. What do you think?
