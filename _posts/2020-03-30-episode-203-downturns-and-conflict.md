In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I am worried it is only a matter of time before the growing pandemic impacts the job market. I work for a young start up, and as of yet I am gainfully employed. But if this goes on as long as some folks say it will, I'm just not sure. I've heard there was a software job market crash after the dot com boom. What was that like ? What's the best thing to do if you get laid off in a market downturn? Wait it out? Look for software jobs? Switch industries, temporarily?


2. I'm a technical lead on a small team. Two of my teammates are constantly annoyed with each other and I need to know how to talk them down so we can be a better team. Let me introduce them:
   
   Alice (the names are made up), an experienced programmer, who is slower to catch on, keeps dragging old arguments and old ways of thinking in, works very slowly and in her own vacuum, and often comes across as difficult to work with. Alice constantly disagrees with the team on things like naming conventions and solutions to problems.
   
   In the other corner, Bob, a 2nd year coder, eager to follow leadership but still learning when to ask for help. He takes criticism constructively, but not from Alice because to him it sounds like fingernails on a chalkboard.
   
   Alice and Bob constantly bump heads. Yesterday, Bob rewrote Alice's stored procedure because it was slow and he had some ideas with how to reuse some code. Today it was SQL formatting - Bob's SQL is ugly, according to Alice, who wants to confront him on it. I suggested we create a style guide to settle that argument.
   
   This kind of thing has been going on since the team was formed. My question is, what can I do? They both look to me as the leader, and I don't want to take sides, but we've had this problem for nearly two years.
