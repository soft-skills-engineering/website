In episode 28, Jamison and  Dave answer these questions:

## How long should I stay before I quit my job?

- Two to three years seems fairly normal.
- Dave sees people with less than 12 months regularly.
- Staying at a job means you experience things you wouldn't if you hopped around a lot.
- It is much easier to see the [hype cycle](http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp) play out if you stick around.
- You get to see the outcome of your own decisions.
- Quitting usually == raise.
- Chronic job hopping *might* result in a reputation of not sticking with things.
- Dave thinks you should quit your first job after 18 months because of the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)

## How do you encourage junior developers to improve?

- We assume that these junior developers really want to improve.
- Make it clear that people get stuck and struggle, and that is normal.
- Make it clear that you don't want them to get *too* stuck.
- Make it OK to ask questions.
- [People generally live up or down to your expectations](https://twitter.com/superSGP/status/693933815144779776), so help them feel trusted and that you expect they will be great.
- Make the outcome of their work clear.
