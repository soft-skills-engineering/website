[Dave](https://twitter.com/djsmith42) and [Jamison](https://twitter.com/jergason) answer these questions:

1. I'm a junior developer on a team of seniors, and I'm also the Scrum Master. Our team has *lots* of problems. What do I do?
2. Jamison openly talks about not finishing his degree. How did he put it on his resume or explain it to potential employers?

In question two Jamison discovers he has been lying on his LinkedIn profile for half a decade, and freaks out a little bit. The mistake is corrected, but can the damage ever be undone? Tune in next week on *SOFT SKILLS ENGINEERING*.
