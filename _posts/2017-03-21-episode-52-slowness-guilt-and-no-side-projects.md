[Dave](https://twitter.com/djsmith42) and [Jamison](https://twitter.com/jergason) answer these questions:

1. I feel guilty about how slow I'm working. What should I do?
2. I'd like to find a job, but I don't have any completed side projects or an interesting GitHub profile. How can I explain this?
