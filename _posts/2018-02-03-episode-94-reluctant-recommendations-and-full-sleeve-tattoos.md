This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. As a "less than ideal" engineer was leaving our team, he asked if he could use me as a job reference. How should I tell them no?
2. What are your thoughts on having full sleeve tattoos (ie, tattoos that cover the entire arm) within engineering?
