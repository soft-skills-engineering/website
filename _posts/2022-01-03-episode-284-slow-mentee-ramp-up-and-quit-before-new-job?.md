In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I started working at a new company last month. I'm just under senior level (I-II-III-Sr) and I am working on a project with someone slightly more junior, who started there a few months earlier, to help them complete a project on time.
   
   Despite my best efforts, I can't get on the same page with them. They ignore half of my suggestions, don't give me straight answers to my questions, take forever to review pull requests, and are making very little progress each day without reaching out for help. I am not certain what to do, but I'm worried I'll leave a bad impression with my new manager (who is actually pretty reasonable, I'm just paranoid) by missing the deadline, which is in *checks watch* 1 week.
   
   Any suggestions? Should I quit my job? (leave that option off the table for now)

2. I hate my current job and cannot see myself working here for more than a few months. Is it better to find a new job before quitting? If I quit tomorrow with no offers from other companies, how does this affect salary negotiation for a new job while I'm currently unemployed? Finance-wise, I'm stable enough to not be working for months to a year but I am worried about not having current employment putting me at a disadvantage in my job search. Not working would definitely free up my time and energy (which is being steadily drained each day) to prepare for interviews.
   
   I recently got a raise and promotion to a senior role too. Does quitting shortly after look bad on a resume? I could coast for the next few months in my current job while I search for a new one but I feel like this would be in bad faith. It takes a long time to actually fire someone at my company for performance, even if I barely do any work.
   
   Thanks for reading my question. Love the show.
