In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I'm so glad I discovered your podcast last week! You guys are hilarious (I laugh to myself in the car) and you talk about issues that I have thought about since coming into the "adult world".
   
   I'm a new CS grad and have started as a new hire at the company I interned with last summer. I'm on my third week of full-time employment but I still feel like an intern. One of my supervisors even jokes and calls me an intern. I know it is a joke, but I feel degraded. I'm the youngest (at 22) and the only woman on my team surrounded by people who have been on the program for 5+ years. The people around me are VERY technical.
   
   I have slowly been getting information about what the program does, but it still isn't clicking as fast as I want it to (compared to what I had experienced in my time at university). I have no experience in and have not learned any of the concepts they have been talking about. I feel that my CS degree does not matter and I feel that I am not competent enough and don't deserve my place at this company; I'm not as technical as the other employees.
   
   I feel that since I have said I have my degree in CS, people expect me to learn fast and be "technical". Am I setting myself up with unreasonable expectations? How can I prove to myself and to others that I deserve to be a part of the team and the program as a full-time employee?


2. My team works closely with another team, and the manager of that team is...difficult. Most of my interactions with him have resulted in him getting defensive and frustrated, and nearly become arguments. I try pretty hard to remain polite, but we usually don't accomplish anything.
   
   I'm not sure that I want to mention this to my manager, or to his, because I'm worried that word will reach him that I ""tattled"", which will just make things worse. He's also more senior than me and has been at the company longer, so if this conflict does escalate, I feel the company would probably take his side.
   
   I otherwise really like this job, so the age old advice of quitting is not an option here. Besides just trying to avoid any interactions with him, what can I do?
   
   Thanks for much for the help.
