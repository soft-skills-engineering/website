Dave and Jamison were out this week, so we have a re-run of a DEEP CUT for you.

This originally aired as episode 18. We answer these two questions:

1. I have a part-time job as a developer while I'm still in school. Should I drop out and just work full time?
2. How do I prepare for a job interview?
