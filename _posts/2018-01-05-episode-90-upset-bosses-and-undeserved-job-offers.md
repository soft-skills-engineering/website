This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. Upper management has a negative impression of me because of an early manager. How do I manage and improve my reputation with mid and upper level management, who I interact with very rarely?
2. I have a job offer I feel unqualified for. Should I decline this offer I honestly don't deserve, or face a massive amount of impostor syndrome and risk not delivering?
