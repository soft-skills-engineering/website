In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. I'm a technical lead and I'm planning to take the usual advice and quit my job. The catch is, I have a not-yet-vested interest in staying until the new year. My manager mentioned in passing that he's doing resource planning for my team for next year. Should I indicate that I'll be looking for work in the new year?
   
   I feel like I have a guarded relationship with my manager, so I don't feel like it's a safe space to say just anything. But I know it would be helpful for him to know that I'm leaving.


2. I work at a consulting company and I've been outsourced to one of the biggest banks to work on their iOS application. My problem is every time I propose a solution, it bounces back and is never accepted. In my opinion our way of doing things is wrong and I lost motivation and enthusiasm to work on the project. I shared my concerns and thoughts and always got the pat on my back but never found a solution. In these kind of situations, how do you motivate yourself to keep going? Should I look at it as improving my people management skills or should I quit? Thank you both of you. I don't feel alone when I listen your podcast and I'm simply thankful your existence.
