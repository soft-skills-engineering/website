In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. Listener Anonomomonous asks,
   
   How do you influence people and change minds?
   
   I work on a team where things often happen by inertia. I have a lot of ideas about how to improve our process, scope our work better, collaborate more effectively etc. I'm comfortable with sharing my concerns and suggestions with my manager and the rest of the team but the opinion of any single developer is usually politely noted and ignored.
   
   As an individual contributor, what's the best way to influence the rest of your team and your manager without being the overly critical toxic person who tries to shut down every idea?


2. For those who work in a "flat" hierarchy structure, is it unreasonable to ask for a 30~35% pay raise? Normally that would sound like an absurd ask. However, given the fact that everyone is considered an "engineer", the higher compensation that comes with a promotion isn't available any other way than explicitly asking for it (as far as I know).
   
   Not looking to jab an employer for more money, especially since I like my current one, but since what I'm doing on a daily basis sounds an awful lot like the senior engineer positions I hear about, I naturally would like my pay to reflect what I do.
   
   What do you suggest?
