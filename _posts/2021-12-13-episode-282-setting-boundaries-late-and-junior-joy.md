In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Listener Rafael asks,
   
   If you've already been working at a company for several months, how do you set boundaries with your employer as to when, time during the day, it's acceptable for them to contact you? What can you say to your employer or colleagues if they expect you to respond to correspondence at all times, with a 30-min turn around? Can you adjust expectations after you've been working the role for several months, or is it too late?

2. Hi, Do you see any benefits to being a junior developer? Any advice you would give to a junior, like "Hey, do this while you're still a junior, once you're a senior+ it might be harder to do or find time for it"?
