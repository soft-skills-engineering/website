In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. A listener named Metal Mario asks,
   
   A few weeks back in Episode 395 you talked about working with a superstar teammate. I feel like for our team, I'm the superstar.
   
   We're a small software team in a large non-software company. I joined a year ago and very quickly took on a lot of responsibility. I think I'm a fantastic fit for the team, received \*outstanding\* feedback in my annual review as well as during the course of the year, and I get along great with my teammates. However, there are two problems.
   
   I joined the team on a lower salary compared to the rest of the team. I was initial ok with it because I changed to a completely new tech stack as well as a new role. Now I strongly feel like I should earn more than my colleagues. My boss hinted that he agreed in my annual review.
   
   I fear that by me joining the team and demanding a substantial pay raise, the cake gets smaller for the rest of the team, and that they feel like me joining the team prevented them to rising through the ranks.
   
   The second problem is related: a colleague of mine (mildly) complained that he lost responsibilities to me since I've joined the team. I talked to my boss about that, but given that things have been going very well, my boss would like me to keep doing the tasks.
   Again- Iâ€™m worried that my colleagues might get spiteful with me.
   
   Would it be better to take it down a notch (in order not to endanger team happiness and keep things stable for the company), or should I perform to the best of my abilities all the time?

2. Impoverished By Pro-ration asks,
   
   Is it reasonable for a company to pro-rate raises for new employees?
   
   I recently received a raise that was smaller than expected as part of a promotion I got 9 months after joining the company. I joined halfway through the year and was under-leveled, so I quickly was put up for promotion, and got it! My raise was about half what I expected, and when I asked HR, they told me that the policy is to prorate raises, so because I joined halfway through the year, I only get half the raise that the promotion should come with, so instead of the 20% I was expecting to bring me up to the salary range of the job level I originally applied for, I only got 10% and am now making less than I think I should.
   
   Have I permanently crippled my lifetime earnings?!?
   
   What can I do to get the company to pay me appropriately? I understand if bonuses are pro-rotated, but why would raises also be pro-rated?
