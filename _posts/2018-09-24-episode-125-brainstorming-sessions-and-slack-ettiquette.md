In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hey guys! Do you have any tips for making ""brain storming sessions"" more bearable?
   
   In my experience, I've found that it's very hard to keep this type of meeting productive. I don't think this is necessarily anyone's fault, and I love the idea of making sure all sorts of folks have a path to contribute, but many times when I've seen these types of meetings organized, many participants don't have enough context, or subject matter expertise to produce genuinely helpful ideas.
   
   I think it's really powerful when cross-discipline teams collaborate well on a project or feature, so I guess I'm wondering if there are practical ways to generate the culture of trust and mutual respect that is needed for this to actually work.
   
2. First time question asker, long time listener here. We have a Really Important Problem at work: in Slack, people tend to use @channel instead of @here. What are some strategies for educating everyone that they should be using @here and not @channel? I especially don't want anyone to feel shamed or called-out in the moment. Thanks!
