In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Ever since I graduated from college, I've been working in a rising tech company for almost 5 years. I've been working on some project and different teams, and it has been more than 1 year on my current team. One day, someone mentioned me that their service is down because of my code from when I was on the previous team and I didn't even touch that code for almost 2 years. I explained that I am in different team now, so I refer them to the current members of my old team. I also gave some suggestion on how to fix it, but that team didn't respond fast enough and eventually other person fixed it. Somehow I feel really guilty that I didn't do anything to fix it. My question is: Until when I responsible for the code I wrote? Is it as long as I'm on the team, or as long as I'm still working in the company? Please advise. Thank you.


2. An external recruiter learned what would be on my technical screen from a previous candidate and shared that with me. Should I warn company X that their technical screen is compromised?
