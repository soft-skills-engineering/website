Thanks to all the people who pointed us to the [Single Level of Abstraction Principle](http://principles-wiki.net/principles:single_level_of_abstraction) which we obliquely referred to in [episode 57](http://softskills.audio/2017/04/25/episode-57-management-tasks-i-hate-and-difficult-co-workers/).

We answer these two questions:

1. How can I convince management to pay for developer training?
2. Should I mention unrelated experience on an application?
