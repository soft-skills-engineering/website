In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. How should I deal with the product I am building being called "the worst tool in the domain I've ever used"?
   The product I'm working on is quite old, has many customers, but by no means is a product everyone loves or even talks about. Most of the public feedback I see is negative, with very little praise or even good words about it.
   Lately, it's been straining me and affecting my motivation to work on this product, even though otherwise I like working on it, with the great team, good tech stack and so on.
   Thanks!


2. Hi! I miss going to the gym (because of lockdown) and listening to your podcast while I do cardio! My question: I'm a freelance developer working remotely in a team of other freelancers. This is my first full remote and freelance job setup. Recently, I've been feeling like the other developers are "just letting the meter run", as it takes them a long time to complete tasks (without writing unit tests or documentation), the tickets they work on don't pass initial QA, they log in late in the day and disappear in the afternoon usually without leaving a slack message or status. Is it understandable to think so negatively about them all the time should I just mind my own business and just manage my feelings? Help appreciated - I have been thinking of leaving this project because of them, which is unfortunate because the company and their product are interesting. Thanks!
