In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. What is the right balance between asking for help and figuring things out on my own? How do I know when it's time to ask questions or when it's time to spend more time drilling down into the code?

2. Been at my first job for a couple of years now, and I am very quiet in the workplace and still find it hard to open up, be assertive, and speak up in meetings.

   When I try to go out of my comfort zone (arguing about technical decisions, setting up and driving meetings), I don't think my manager appreciates my efforts. I am told that I need to voice my opinions more and have more of a two-way conversation. I feel I'm not given concrete chances to improve, and it's very demotivating. How should I deal in situations like this?
