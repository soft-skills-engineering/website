In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. My company recently had a kerfuffle where some teams felt that reviewing a PR in less than 3 weeks was an unreasonable ask.
   
   As such, the company is trying to come up with guidelines for cross-team asks.  The current proposal is for work of 1-2 hours they will commit to an SLA of 6 months.  I feel this is a polite way of saying no to any request.
   
   Are there any ways we could come a more reasonable agreement on this?


2. Hi, my laptop has died after upgrading to MacOS Monterrey and I’ve been given a 2017 Macbook with poor specs as a replacement due to no fault of my own.
   
   I’m at a startup of around 100 employees and I don’t think we’ve got a mature set up in terms of getting replacement machines.
   
   I’m a Senior Engineer and need a speedy laptop for my intense role. It’d be faster for me to use my personal MacBook than using the replacement, but I don’t think that would be allowed.
   
   How would you suggest I go about requesting a replacement MacBook with specs that fit my role? Do companies have budgets set aside for these expenses?
   
   Thanks
