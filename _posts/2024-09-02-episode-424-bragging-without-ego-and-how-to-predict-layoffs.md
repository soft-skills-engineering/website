In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Listener Billy Bob Taco asks,
   
   I work at a small-medium startup, as a member of a very small team (read: just me). I work on infrastructure and APIs that support every other team, such as mobile and web clients, as well as other services. I’m relatively junior, and had to work hard to prove myself in this role. I do 100% of the system design and maintenance as well as feature development. I’ve been told on job interviews that I came across as a “little egotistical” when describing the role and the impact its had, but I don’t really know how to soften it! It’s my experience that I’m talking about when trying to share my ability and potential to fill a role. Help?

2. Listener TimeDisplacementBox says,
   
   Great show, your future episodes just keep getting better and better. I have a question about avoiding lay offs. In this timeline I recently joined a large company out of college. I worked hard and surpassed goals set by my manager, getting very positive feedback at review time.
   
   However, a few weeks ago I started hearing that the company was over budget in engineering, huge changes started happening in upper management, and less work started flowing to our team.  The concern was grounded in reality as one morning the company disbanded the team and laid off some of the newer hires including me.
   
   Aside from additional time travel, are there any questions I can ask during interviews to help ensure I am getting into a team that is safe from lay offs?  And on the job, can you directly ask your manager if lay offs are in the future, or do you just need to watch out for the signs?
