In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I started my first job as a developer 2 months ago. My boss wants me to give talks at meetups and then later, conferences.

   I have no idea what I can talk about as I am still very much learning.

   How do I find a topic to research and work on so that I can deliver value to people listening to my talk?

2. What are some things I can try to increase the scale of my annual raise or bonus? For example, if my company averages a 2% raise each year, but I really want a 3% raise this year, how might I go about it?
