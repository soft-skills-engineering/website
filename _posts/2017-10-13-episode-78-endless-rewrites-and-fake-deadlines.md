This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. We've re-written the project I'm on 10 times without launching. What should I do?
2. I worked hard to hit a deadline, only to find out the deadline was moved. How do I avoid this in the future?

We talked a bit about the value of deadlines way back in [episode nine](https://softskills.audio/2016/05/02/episode-9-deadlines-and-titles/) if you want to hear some positive things about deadlines.
