In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. There aren't a lot of engineering management growth resources in my company. It's a relatively small company with about 50 engineers. My manager doesn't have time to properly mentor me. And I'm not sure I would want him to because I feel like his advice isn't always the best. Where can I go for management mentorship or other learning resources? Is it worth exploring non-engineering managers on other teams? Or leaning more on my peers? Or should I be looking for outside advice?

2. A recent episode mentioned awkward Zoom silences. My experience is the exact opposite.
   
   I recently switched teams at the same company. This new team has a Zoom room open for the entire work day. The first person to start their day begins the Zoom and the last to leave ends the meeting. They do "mob programming" using a command line tool that switches users every few minutes along with all the strict rules of Extreme Programming - a driver, navigator, etc. But they also do everything in groups: story refinement, diagrams, documentation, everything. Live collab, all day,  every day.
   
   I'm one month into this transfer but worried that this isn't a good fit and that I made a horrible mistake. ALL the other engineers here rave about how this is the greatest thing ever. Am I the weirdo for not liking it? I feel like I am of split-mind to only either speak or type (but not both) and have not yet rediscovered my coding flow.
   
   Mostly I just wanted to roll a perception check with you: Am I the weirdo for not liking all this collaboration and 100% Zooming, or would this workflow drive most other engineers mad as well? Any pep talk about sticking it out would be appreciated.
