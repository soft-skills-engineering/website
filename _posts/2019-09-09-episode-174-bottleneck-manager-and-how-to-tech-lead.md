In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. "I'm into my second job of leading a team of software engineers and want to level up my coaching skills. In my first role I accidentally fell into the deep end of management "fun" by taking on a team of 10 people. One of the big problems I faced was being the "go to" or "sign off" person for a lot of different things, and I perpetuated this problem by showering people with my incredible answers (based on my obviously incredible know-it-all-ness) and thus reinforcing my goto factor. I was aware of coaching as a concept then, but didn't incorporate it into my leadership style, which I believe contributed to my eventual burn out in the role.
   
   Over the last year in my current team lead role I've been much more deliberate about various aspects of leadership, but my coaching prowess is still struggling. When I'm asked questions by my team, my default response is to jump to a specific answer based on my own opinion, and it's only afterwards that I slap my forward and yell out "missed coaching opportunity!" (as people near me back away slowly with concerned looks on their faces).
   
   What are some effective techniques to try and build a habit of using coaching as a primary means to help my team work through problems?


2. I just became a technical lead for a team at my company. I've never held a leadership role like this before. Do you have any advice for how to do a good job?
