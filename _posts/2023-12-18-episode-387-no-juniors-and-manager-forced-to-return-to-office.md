In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hello Dave and Jamison, I wanted to say thank you for your podcast. It's been a great wealth of information and comic relief. Can we bring back the guitar intros?
   
   I work in the technology arm of a large corporation. There are no younger engineers. I am one of the youngest at just shy of 30 (my first tech job after going back to school).
   
   I receive praise for my eagerness to learn and grow and how much I try to engage with the org. I feel like if we hired more Junior engineers it would both increase the engagement of the org and give senior engineers more of a sense of purpose to pass the torch. One of my favorite engineers from whom I get the best advice has been here for over 20 years and they are awesome!
   
   I also get great advice from people on my team but some of them are cruising or in a "couple years till retirement" mode.
   
   Should I try to convince management to hire more junior engineers? Is there anything I can do to relate more to older org members?

2. Hi Dave and Jamison! I'm an engineering manager tasked with getting the team back to an open office (hybrid). My team works very well remotely, with the occasional in-person meetup. I believe that in terms of productivity, work-life balance, engagement, and turnover, RTO will negatively impact the team. I'm torn between representing what I feel is good for the team and supporting the company's decision. I've already expressed my concerns with management, and the overall sentiment seems to be that anyone who doesn't like it can find a new job. Aside from this, I like my job, team and company and don't want to quit over this. Any tips on finding a balance representing team needs and implementing higher-up direction?
