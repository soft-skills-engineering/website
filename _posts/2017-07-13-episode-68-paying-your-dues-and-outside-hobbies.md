Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. It's been a year and I still haven't touched the codebase. What should I do?
2. All my hobbies revolve around computers. How do I develop other interests?

Jamison mentioned Dan Luu's article on how bad teams are always hiring. [Here](https://danluu.com/hiring-lemons/) it is.

Rich Hickey's [Hammock-Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc) talk was also mentioned.
