In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hey guys, I've graduated with a CS degree 8 years ago, but due to circumstances I accepted a QA job because I wasn't getting any other offers. Well 8 years later, I'm still stuck in QA and would love to move into development. I tried transferring within companies and applying to developer jobs, but the QA brand is holding me back. Any advice on how I can become a developer when I'm pigeon-holed in QA?


2. Hi folks! I need your wisdom! Please help.
   TLDR: Senior as a Programmer, Junior as a Mobile developer.
   
   When I first came to my job as an intern, my manager asked me what I wanted to do more - backend stuff, testing, or mobile development. I went randomly and chose the latter. It became my profile and I've grown to really like it. Over the years, life has thrown me back and forth, I've been on multiple different projects not related to mobile, so now I can do... everything? Or rather, nothing.
   I know a little bit about .NET, a little about web development, writing Visual Studio extensions, IoT, machine learning, Unity game dev.. This is good because  I can now quickly learn new things, know a lot of tricky stuff, know how to communicate with customers. I have a decent salary and good feedback.
   
   But the huge downside to that is that I stayed exactly at the same level of mobile development as I was 3 years ago. I know basic stuff, a little bit of advanced stuff, but I have zero experience in all the ""hot"" things like RxJava, Dagger, Kotlin.
   
   All the job vacancies I've seen require a strong knowledge of something particular: be it Android or iOS development, backend or frontend. I'm suffering from a huge imposter syndrom - yes, I have all the ""good"" programmer qualities, I'm smart, but I have no advanced or even medium knowledge in anything.
   What can you advise me?
   
   Huge thanks and... love the show! ‚ù§
