In this re-run of episode 79, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. It seems like my teams always miss their story point commitments. Is this normal? How do you change it?
2. How do you actually measure developer productivity?

The article comparing research on productivity in static and dynamic type systems is [here](https://danluu.com/empirical-pl/). It is a great read.

Jamison also mentions Goodhart's Law. Read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law).
