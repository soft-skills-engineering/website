In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. This question came with a delightful ASCII-art diagram that I will now dictate as follows: "pipe space space space space" JK
   
   TLDR: I want to move up the ranks but I'm not sure what might await me... except meetings. What should I expect? And how do I get there?
   
   Too Small, Want MOAR!
   I work in a big enterprise as a Tech Lead in an ""agile team"". So day-to-day I focus on getting our team to build the current feature we're meant to be building (eg by helping other devs, attending meetings, and sometimes writing code). The next step for my career would be what we call an "Engineering Lead" but I'm having a hard time figuring out what that role actually is and our "EL" is so slammed with meetings I'm afraid to take any of their time to ask... SO - Dave & Jamison, can you enlighten me? What might the goals and life be of someone at that level and how would someone who still codes every day(ish) start figuring out what to do to get there?
   
   P.S. It's taken me about 4 years but I've finally managed to listen to every single SSE episode! (I have a kid, binging podcasts isn't possible for me).
   P.P.S. In an interview recently I was asked ""What's the most valuable piece of advice you were ever given?"" to which I replied ""To negotiate for better benefits in job interviews, got it from a podcast called 'Soft Skills Engineering'"". The interviewer thought that was cool, subscribed to your podcast during the interview then REFUSED TO NEGOTIATE ON ANYTHING! >:(


2. Living in a small town my options as a software engineer have been limited to working for one company straight out of uni for 7 years. Wanting to develop in my career, and knowing you have advised others in the past to move on from their first job out of uni. What is your opinion of seeking out and switching jobs into remote work? Will this provide the same development value found in a traditional job switch, especially after the impact COVID has had on the way companies see remote work.
