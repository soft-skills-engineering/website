In episode 14, Jamison and  Dave answer these questions:

Since I am primarily a web developer, I often find there is a bit of developer prejudice, against web developers from software engineers of other categories. Often I find they think I am not capable of anything other than jquery dom manipulations, and talk down at me like I wouldn't understand their expertly setup mysql queries. As it turns out, I too have my CS degree, and start new projects in all kinds of programming languages just to learn them. Any tips for breaking the web dev stereo types?

How to deal with legacy code and legacy coders?  The code was probably good once, but it is impossible to maintain and doesn't work on new hardware.  You know the best approach is to scrap it and start from scratch but the original coder is resistant and wants to find a way to "make it work".  What do you do? In my situation, this legacy coder is a peer, and the only person above us doesn't want to take a side on the argument, so we are left at a stale-mate.
