In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hey friends, thanks for such an entertaining show, I look forward to it every week.
   
   My question relates to 'leveling up' as a developer.  I've been getting nice feedback for my work on projects and the blog post updates I've been writing along the way.  This has been noticed by colleagues, managers and the local meetup organising committees in my city. I have now been asked to speak at a number of events internally and in the community. While I am very flattered they enjoy my writing I am not interested in hitting the local 'speaking circuit' and would prefer to focus on building, writing and mentoring without getting up on stage.
   
   Is it 'ok' to say no to speaking when it simply does not spin my wheels or is this a mandatory 'thing' I must get on board with to progress my career?


2. I am a tech lead on a team where, for the most part, people are friendly, optimistic and professional. There is one engineer who is mostly upbeat and has shown real potential but in certain contexts, e,g, retros and the odd technical conversation becomes a crippling black hole of negativity. The person in question is quite young, relative to the rest of the team, has only ever worked at our company, they are well compensated and have great opportunities to work on exciting green field projects, every developers dream right?
   
   What could I be missing? I don't want to lose this person but I can't help but feel that they need to grow in maturity and somehow, despite pointed feedback, that's not happening here.
   
   What do you think I should do to stop the chronic pessimism, which I'm afraid if not rectified soon will lead to more victims?
