In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. How do I help foster team spirit in a newly created team?
2. I work for small startup (fewer than 10 people). My boss wants to hire another developer and asked me to look around for people.

   I don't feel particularly strongly about this team. I've been there for about a year, but I don't imagine myself working there for another twelve months.

   I don't want to refer my friends because I don't want them to join a team I don't feel good about.

   On the other hand, I want to work with great people. I see how other devs may enjoy working in such an environment, but it's just not for me.

   In the long run, I obviously want to leave this job, but what would you recommend doing in short term? Is hiring under such circumstances really that different than hiring if I liked this team?
