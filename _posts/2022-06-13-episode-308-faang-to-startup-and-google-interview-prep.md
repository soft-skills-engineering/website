In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I'm currently working at a FAANG in Europe, and seriously underpaid. I recently got an offer from a US startup (Series C funded) to work remotely. Two big pluses: I'm gonna get a 2 times pay bump, and I can finally work remotely (and travel across Europe since they support work from anywhere, now that COVID restrictions are relaxed, something I wanted to do for years). Two problems: Their tech stack is Ruby on Rails, something that no "big" companies use so I may not be considered seriously because of last X years of working on a not-so-famous tech, and current tech environment screams of a recession, so I'm safer at a big company than some startup. Do you think 2.5 years in a FAANG provides enough of credibility to take care of both of these problems if things go south? Any other factors I should consider when moving from FAANG to a remote startup job?

2. So I've been working at this big-tech company for around 4 years and working as a mid-level engineer. I recently got approached by a Google recruiter for L5 or Senior engineer position. I've led a few projects in my current company, but I don't consider myself a "senior" level. That and the fact that I've worked majorly in Frontend  and the role I'm gonna be getting interviewed for is Full-stack (interview rounds seem to be focused on Distributed systems mostly).
   
   I've two questions:
   - Is this some dirty trick in recruitment I gotta be aware of? I hear about downlevel a lot, but never "uplevel".
   - If say I do prepare like crazy and pass the interviews, do you think I may not have any luck with the team matching Google does? Like no team may wanna hire a "junior" senior?
   
   Love the show! Keep it up.
