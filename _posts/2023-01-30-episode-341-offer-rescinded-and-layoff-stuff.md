In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I am an American student finishing my undergraduate degree in computer science in the Midwest this semester. I am concerned about the economic climate of the technology industry. I am doing my second internship at a major technology company this summer (Microsoft). After that I will go to graduate school and try to ride out the storm. I have applied nearly a dozen programs including one year and two year masters programs, and even a few PhD programs (MIT plz accept me). My biggest concern is having my offer rescinded. I thought there might be economic turbulence, so last summer I had my return offer place me in the most profitable and highest growth division of the company. How do lay-off decisions get made on the issue of rescinding offers versus laying off people?  How can I reduce the risk of the offer getting pulled? I am working on finding another software engineering internship, but itâ€™s extremely difficult to find any open roles.

2. Listener Andre says,
   
   I need a gut check here. I have a senior engineer on my team that does not perform well. He keeps procrastinating on tasks that I know wouldn't take much effort. I think it would be great for the team and the company to substitute this engineer for someone with more passion. One idea I have is to volunteer this person to my director to be laid off.
   
   It would be great for the engineer to feed on the potential 3-month severance package.
   
   Firing him doesn't seem like an option because he does the bare minimum for his role.
   
   What would you do?
