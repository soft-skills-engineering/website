In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Earlier I decided I would quit my corporate engineering job in 2022. I'd stagnated, I wasn't writing as much code as I wanted, and my company made me write our services in an internal domain specific language (DSL), which I don't like. I've put off quitting due to anxiety reasons and not knowing exactly what I want to do next. I've even thought about taking a short gap to figure things out, but maybe that's just me being a dramatic young person (I graduated university in May of 2020).
   
   However, now my company has done something terrible and promoted me to a second level engineer! And my manager has actually listened to my feedback! How could they?
   
   I still want to leave because the DSL ruins my coding skills and won't transfer elsewhere. I work with great people. Also, I play an important role in the group because we've had so much turnover this past year. I don't want to fall into the trap of thinking "the grass is always greener on the other side", but I think leaving would be best for my career. How can I approach this without giving the impression that I'm flaky or ungrateful? And should I stop deliberating and quit my job sooner rather than later?

2. I started a new position three months ago for a large pay increase, I am a fully remote software dev on a team of mostly local developers. My manager-to-be left the company a week before I started, and has not been replaced. The onboarding has been extremely lacking, I don’t have a mentor or buddy, I have very little l communication with my direct manager, and I have very little guidance on what to actually do, so I have been doing… nothing. Some days I do not even open my laptop. How do I start the conversation with my manager that I need something to do, without revealing openly that I have been doing nothing for the past three months?
