In episode 18, Jamison and  Dave answer these questions:

I'm a computer science major who still has a couple years of school left. I also have a part time job doing web development. I love what I'm learning and doing at work to the point that I question if it's worth investing two more years into school. How would you counsel someone in my position?

From listener Antonio: How do I prepare for an interview?
