In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. I have a question about 'title inflation', where you get promoted faster than your experience would normally suggest for that specific title. If I've been a 'Senior Software Engineer' for all of a year, and am now getting recruiting offers for Director and VP of Engineering jobs, is it worth interviewing and seeing where it goes? I don't really see myself at that level, but I... might be able to level up to it quickly!


2. Should I take a remote work offer or find a new job in a new place?
   I am moving to another country with my husband in 2 months. I am the only frontend developer in the team and my company has been having difficulty hiring people, so my boss asked me if I could work for the company as a remote employee. I am reluctant to the offer because my plan has always been to find a new job so that I can blend in with the local community. Not to mention the 12-hour time difference and lack of new challenges. Sadly, I find it difficult to reject him and leave my colleagues behind. What is a better action to take?
