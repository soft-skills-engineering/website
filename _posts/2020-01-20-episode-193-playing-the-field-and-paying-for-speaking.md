In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I've been recently looking for summer internships and I have had a couple of video interviews. I don't consider myself an interview rookie since I've had my fair share but there is one question I can't understand whether to answer honestly or not so here it goes: "Are you applying to other job opportunities?". The question is kind of stupid since no one puts all of its eggs in one basket but on the other hand I'm afraid answering 'yes' will make it seem as if I don't care about the company (spoiler alert: I don't really care :)). How do I answer honestly to this question and at the same time make them feel like they are special? By the way, love the podcast! 


2. Hi guys! I just started listening to your show and I already have experienced a steep improvement from a puny 10x dev to 11x one.
   My question, if you'll be kind enough to answer is:
   How do I convince my cheapskate boss to sponsor me flying across the pond to give a talk at a conference I was selected for. Should I sponsor it myself in case of a decline? Should I hint at a possible job quitting if I am declined (I am currently seeking a new job)? Should I go forward with the talk if I do quit and the  content of the talk is largely about the job I did there in the last couple of years.
   
   Note, I am widely regarded as an excellent employee by my superiors and colleagues. I earn quite a bit less than my current value and I am currently back, looking for a job.
   
   That's it from me, love you guys!
