[Dave](https://twitter.com/djsmith42) and [Jamison](https://twitter.com/jamison_dance) answer these questions:

1. I went through the interview process, and as last step I had an interview with the VP of engineering. At the end of interview he asked if I had any questions for him. I didn't know what to ask. What do you ask?
2. I'm a front-end web developer on a SCRUM team. Our Product Owner is also our tester, but she has a very busy schedule and she hardly has any time to test anymore.

   My team thinks we need a second product owner, but I think we should hire a dedicated tester to help the PO. How do I convince my team and my manager to hire a tester instead of a second product owner?

   We don't work with scripted test plans or anything, so I think a dedicated tester would be a huge benefit to our team and our deliverables.
