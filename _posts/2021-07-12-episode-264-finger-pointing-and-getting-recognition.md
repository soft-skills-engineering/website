## Questions

1. Hi Mr.Smith and Mr.Dance,
   
   I'm a software engineer at a big software company. I recently learned to self-evaluate and found that I'm really bad at being finger pointed. I am normally an easy-going team player with an open mind. I accept that I can be flawed sometimes, and I would never blame anyone. But whenever someone points their finger at me and says "this bug is caused by YOU!" or more commonly "this bug is caused by YOUR systems!" (sometimes with facepalm emojis or this emoji 🤷), I suddenly become super defensive and frantically try to find counter evidence to prove that it is indeed THEIR system that is at fault, or at least some OTHER systems that is at fault, but definitely NOT MINE. After I cool down for a few days, I regain my composure and realize that what I have done was wrong and not useful to the discussion. This is specifically in the context of informal issue debugging between teams, not strictly a blameless postmortem meeting.
   
   I think blaming others is not a good behavior and makes the workplace toxic and unproductive. I would like to improve myself (and others). Any suggestions and recommendations?


2. First of all I have to say a big THANK YOU to the work you've been developing, it's helping me a lot to set my expectations and pave my career path. So, to the question...
   
   I'm currently working for a large Brazilian fintech and I'm starting to get a little bit annoyed by the lack of acknowledgement. I've already made it clear to my managers a couple of times and I always received great feedbacks and always performed "above the expectations" for my level. But in the last 1:1 we had I was a little bit more insistent about it and the explanation they gave me was "we know that our developers are above the average, we know that a Junior here can easily get Mid-level or even Senior in other companies, but we want to be a tech reference in the country and we don't want to spoil the devs by promoting them a couple of times in the same year". I understand this ambition but it got me a little bit frustrated. Of course I don't want to be a mercenary nor a mediocre developer, but if this is the objective they're aiming they should at least pay a competitive salary. This conversation really demotivated me, it seems to me they just want a high specialized work-force for a cheap price. I really appreciate everything I'm able to learn inside the company, for sure everyone is above average and being there is like being in school and it's been really cool. But I'm starting to question if this "trade-off" of low pay and high learning makes sense once you're already in the Mid-level corporate world. I'm pretty sure I can double my salary in the next month if I wanted to - a couple o recruiters contacted me in linkedin and I also made some interviews -, but this "tech reference and always learning" thing keeps bothering me and I wonder how much of it really makes a difference in the long run.
