In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hey Dave and Jamison, long time listener of the show. looking to get your advice on dealing with guilt at work. Lately, I've found myself in a lot of situations of having to deal with bugs/incompleteness after pushing out a feature. It's not my intention to be careless and I do feel like I'm giving it my 100% but there seems to keep being thing after thing that I'm not catching. It's impossible to sweep these things under the rug when you have to put up a follow-up pull request to fix something that was clearly your fault. I feel like every once in a while is okay but when it starts to become a pattern, I wonder how this may reflect on my performance review. My coworkers aren't letting on about any frustrations they may have but every time this happens, I can't help but feel shameful of myself and it's causing my anxiety to hit the roof. I'm waking up for work each morning wondering what's it gonna be this time and feeling pits in my stomach.
   
   Please help.

2. What are your thoughts on low-code platforms? I feel they will end up like WordPress (small companies with the tools in a varying degree of spaghetti that pay a contractor to clean up)
   
   I found myself on a team that wants to use it, and I feel like it’s a detriment to my career. I feel like another employer won’t take me seriously in an interview as I try to explain my way around it.
   
   Is this something I should be concerned about being in too long? I’ve voiced my concerns, but it doesn’t seem like direction is changing. What would you do? How do you feel about low-code in general?
