In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. I'm currently in my first job as a software engineer. Before working full time, I worked at the company as an intern, and during the last few weeks of my internship the engineering manager asked ""We want to bring you on full time. What are your salary expectations?"" Naive me, not wanting to cause any trouble, responded with a very moderate number. They give an offer that was 10% less, but with ""really good benefits,"" so I accepted.
   
   Just over one year later, I feel like I've proven my value to be substantially more than what I asked for, and I know I'm making 10-30% less than my peers. A couple weeks ago, I had my salary review, and rather than the management being open to negotiation (which is what I had expected going in) they just told me ""You'll be making 4% more this year.""
   
   After the meeting, I mentioned to my manager that I felt that the raise wasn't representative of the value that I would be giving the company. He responded that they pay ""Within expected ranges for my job title and experience."" I was a little hurt by this, because I want to be paid based on the value that I provide, not based on my title or experience. I don't think I should quit the job, because I get along well with the team, enjoy my work, and they are paying for my master's tuition on the side. What should I do?


2. Hear ye hear ye, Gods of podcasts, I have a question for thees! I think my salary is ok, Â£60k (UK) and I've brought up the subject of raises a couple of times with my boss (2 years ago and 1 year ago) - both times I was told I'm doing pretty well but they'll look into it. So far no sign of a raise but I'm not annoyed, I really like my job and the people I work with are great.
   
   I'm now on paternity leave and have taken the time to do some interviewing to see what's out there and keep my skills sharp. Turns out I could earn a lot more! Who knew!? I'm now caught between going back to my boss with these other offers to say ""actually no, turns out I'm not doing great, gimmi more money"" or quitting my job for more money but a potentially worse job... help! How do I say ""more money please or I leave"" but nicely?
