In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Listener Bobby ForgedRequest asks
   
   One of my coworker, who is the nicest, most humble person I've ever met, is about twice as productive as I am! They're super-uber productive! They close about 2-3x as many tickets as I do during the same sprint. For reference, I'm a software eng II and they're a senior dev. Their work is very solid too, and they're not just selecting easy, 1 point tickets to pad their stats.
   
   How do you cope with a super star teammate like this? Do I direct more questions towards them to slow them down? Do I volunteer them for more design heavy projects? Jokes aside, I'm curious if this is something that you've seen in your career, and if you were a manager, would this make you feel like the other, not-super-uber-smart teammate, is just not doing enough? Is the answer as simple as "well, sometimes people are just very, very gifted"?

2. In my previous job of 5 years, I worked only 3 hours a day due to a low workload. Seeking a change for career growth, I switched jobs a few months ago, exposing myself to new technologies. Initially stressful, the pace has slowed down, and there's no external pressure to learn. Despite getting praise and raises for minimal effort, I aspire to be a smarter software engineer.
   
   How do I motivate myself to learn and step out of my comfort zone when there's no apparent reward, considering I've easily found new jobs and advanced in my career without exerting much effort?
