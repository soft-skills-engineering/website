In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I've been working with this fintech company for the past year as the only FE developer in a team with other 6 BE developers, but recently, I've noticed that the product team has slowly stopped including frontend (FE) tasks in the sprints. Moreover, they seem to have deprioritized FE tasks in general, allocating me only one task that I can extend at most to three days within a two-week sprint.
   
   This scarcity of work has been bothering me and has left me feeling unwanted in the team, which is particularly pronounced given there's a significant amount of FE work that needs to be done, yet these tasks still don't seem to make it into the sprints.
   
   During our one-on-one sessions, my line manager has given me good feedback, which leaves me even more confused about the situation.
   
   I've raised my concerns about the lack of work with my manager, who simply suggested that I discuss the issue with the product team or feel free to tackle a backend (BE) task. When I've tried to engage with the product team, they usually dismiss me with non-committal responses such as "we have some work coming." and sometimes "we're at max capacity as of the allowed story points in a sprint, try helping where you can". Additionally, when I've attempted to take on some BE tasks, my colleagues often seem too busy to guide me through this new approach, leaving me in absolute frustration.
   
   Other FE developers from different teams seem to be shipping loads of features. Given these circumstances, am I genuinely unwanted on my team? What further actions should I attempt before quitting my job ? any advice is appreciated.

2. I suspect one of my colleagues is either not an actual dev or not as skilled a dev as they claim to be. During meetings, whenever they are asked a question, there is always a very long pause before they unmute, and sometimes when they do unmute, I hear the tail end of a different voice answering the question before they themselves answer the question. Should I bring this up to my manager?
