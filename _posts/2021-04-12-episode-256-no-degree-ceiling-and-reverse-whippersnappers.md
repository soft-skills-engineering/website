## Questions

1. Hiya, thank you for the show. It's very insightful and both of you are pretty charismatic. Without getting too much into details I had a number of difficulties when I was younger which caused me to never finish my computer science degree. I took a job as a Business Intelligence analyst because I needed to move out. Fast forward a few years and I am now an Engineering Manager for one of the biggest companies in the UK - nearly 2000 engineers and around 100.000 employees overall.
   
   I consider myself incredibly successful for my age, just turned 30. I manage two teams(11 and 4 ppl) that are seen as the top performers in the Data Engineering department, and that is credited to my leadership.
   
   I've always been very self conscious of the degree situation. I've tried to finish it online a couple times but I simply can't find how. I am now being asked to apply to my boss' position as Senior Engineering Manager, which could mean being responsible of 6 teams of around 10 people average and a sizeable budget.
   
   I live in constant anxiety from the possibility of hitting a ceiling or being confronted about the degree situation. While I didn't hide it on the interview process It's not something I advertise at all but I got to a point where I just don't know what to do about it. And so that would be my question: What would you advice for someone in my position?


2. I'm working at a small company where we used to have 2 developers. Both of us had at least 10 years of professional experience and both of us are around 28 years old. A few months ago, our bosses decided to hire 3 new FE devs and all of them come from bootcamp.
   
   That wouldn't be so unusual, but all of them are 35+ years old and have families and basically just 6 months of experience. This causes a lot of friction in our team. We're trying to "mentor" them in best practices and experience we've gained over time, but sometimes they don't accept it, because we're just too young for them (in one case 10 years younger).
   
   Do you have any tips how to approach "mentorship" when it comes from younger to older dev? And how to overcome the 10 year barrier?
