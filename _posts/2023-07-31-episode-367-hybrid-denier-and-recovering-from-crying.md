In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. We've recently switched to mandatory 2 days of in-person work a week but my employee keeps working from home! Whenever I ask him to come in person he says sure but continues to work from home. When I confront him about not showing up in person he just says "sorry I wasn't able to make it that day". He's a good employee so I don't want to fire him, but I'm concerned about what upper management will say if/when they find out about this. What should I do?

2. Hi! I am a huge fan of the podcast and a longtime listener.
   
   I recently made a professional judgment call in a high-stress situation that, unfortunately, did not turn out well. It was an excellent learning opportunity for me. Both my team and mentors were very supportive and said they’ve all fumbled at one point in their career.
   
   I was understandably reprimanded in a private meeting with my manager. I embarrassingly started crying halfway through, which I’ve NEVER done before in a professional setting.
   
   I momentarily excused myself to regain my composure, but even after resuming I had to keep the the tissue box close by.
   
   It was awkward, and I could tell my manager was very uncomfortable despite being his kind demeanor. I am worried my reaction will call my reputation and professionalism into question. Please help! How do I recover from this?
