In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I'm on a team of two. My manager/teammate is young (under 30, less than 5 years total work experience), minimally experienced with anything other than writing code, and has an inflated self-assessment of their own coding skills.
   
   They have a habit of either asking for (or simply changing on their own) every little thing to be their own way. This can be as unimportant as renaming all the variables to a different word with the same meaning (think $largeCar instead of $bigCar) or as bad as - after a discussion between two techniques for a feature in which their preferred method wasn't chosen, - going in later and changing the code to how they wanted to do things.
   
   I'm feeling burnt out by the lack of control over my work and feeling like what I'm doing doesn't make a difference..
   
   Where and how *should* you draw lines in order to balance writing good software with showing respect for your team members? How do you deal with people who think their actions are justifiable because they are "improving" the code but really can only defend this by claiming it is "more readable" or some other subjective measure?

2. I work at a well-funded startup and am likely going to be promoted (into another IC engineering role) in the next few months. I'm pretty clear on the leverage I have when negotiating salary before accepting a job offer, but I'm wondering how I should approach negotiation and raise expectations when it comes to receiving a promotion. Obviously, my company wants to retain me, otherwise I wouldn't be getting promoted, but I don't feel confident in negotiating when I'm already being given a raise and my only alternative to accepting it would be to leave and find another job.
   
   Additionally, I'm on great terms with my company and manager and I would not leave over a 5-10k difference in raise expectations. Just want to better prepare myself for the offer. My manager has also told me that when/if I receive a raise, I can negotiate (it's not too late). That came up because I told him I assumed raises and promotions are long processes that need to be decided way in advance, but that is not the case at my company.
