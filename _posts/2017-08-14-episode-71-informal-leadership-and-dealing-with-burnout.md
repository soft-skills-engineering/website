Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. I'm sometimes an informal lead on project teams. How do I help the team get stuff done as a peer?
2. How do I deal with burnout after an extended period of crunch time?

Jamison mentions the blog post by Jamis Buck called [To Smile Again](https://m.signalvnoise.com/to-smile-again-ae0ba9f2198c) where he talks about his experiences with burnout.
