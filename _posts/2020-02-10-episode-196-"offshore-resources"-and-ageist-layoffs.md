In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hi, thank you for the great podcast!
   
   I work for a software consultancy as a senior product manager. For 5+ years, our team of 40 designers, developers and QA has designed, built, deployed, and operated a large SaaS platform. We are passionate about evolving the product, know the domain well and managed to improve a lot of processes in the client’s company. We go way beyond “just development”.
   
   The problem is that the client’s internal staff treats us poorly, especially when it comes to product decisions. As a product manager, I have all the responsibilities of a respective in-house specialist, but almost no power. When I refuse to prioritize a feature that does not make sense based on data and user research, the client’s customer success reps go crazy and escalate it to the CEO. I have seen email threads where internal employees call us “offshore resources”...
   
   How can I change this situation? I don’t want to leave this job because I really like the product I am working on, as well as the team.
   
   Thank you!


2. Connor asks: "I recent round of layoffs at my company has me thinking about my future as a software engineer. Every layoff I've been through, the more tenured employees are the ones let go. I also, generally speaking, haven't seen a lot of older software engineers (50+) in the companies I have worked for. I love programming, but can I reasonably expect to stay employable in this field for the next forty years?
