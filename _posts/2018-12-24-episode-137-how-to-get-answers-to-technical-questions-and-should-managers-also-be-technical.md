In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. What's the best approach to connecting with people who know about specific technologies that could help me if I have a question? And what's the best way to cast a net via co-workers, friends, & family?
   
   The details of my situation are that I'm trying to build a PostgreSQL database from scratch, and I'm running into lots of problems. I spent 2 hours digging through the Postgres documentation, I asked questions on my University Slack channel, and even the PostgreSQL team Slack with no answers. I also reached out to my boss. But I still have no answers.
   
   In any case, I'm just happy I had the wherewithal to walk away after 2 hours instead of spiraling into an absolute rage and wasting my night cursing PostgreSQL.


2. Should a team lead do technical work or restrict himself to people management? What are the pros and cons from each approach?
   
   HR in my company wants to change from a unified model of team and tech leads (single person performing both roles) to a split model (one team lead with multiple tech leads that hold no people management responsibilities) and I'm not sure what to think about this. I feel not having the team leads ""on the ground"" will make them less effective in the people management aspect.
