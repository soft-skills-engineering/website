In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. I have a weekly one-on-one with my manager. What should I talk about in them? Things like feedback and career goals become old and repetitive real soon, and I end up discussing current work items.
   I understand that a one-on-one is my time to ask questions and don't want it to be a longer daily-standup.


2. My front-end team mates are in a power struggle with my back-end team mates and my design team mates. They're intentionally making technical decisions that artificially constrain the choices of other teams.
   
   For example, design wants a certain interaction for a new feature, and my team says "nope, it can't work that way, cause the components we built don't allow that". Or, they make tickets for the back-end team as in "endpoints have to work this or that way, because our components assume that structure". This often seems detrimental and confusing to other teams.
   
   When I push back against my team they are angry. When I defend my team other people are angry. When I try to strike a compromise I feel gross because I usually think my team is wrong. I've tried talking with other teams and managers about the problem. I feel gross about that too because I don't want to point fingers or throw my team mates under the bus. Where should I even start?
