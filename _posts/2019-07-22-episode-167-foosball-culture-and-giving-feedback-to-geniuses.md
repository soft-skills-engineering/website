In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. We've all been on that tour of that local startup that is showing you around their office pointing out all of the amenities. "Over there? That's our foosball table!" You notice no one is playing it and the table and players all look very new and haven't seen much action. You get down to the interview and at the end they ask you if you have any questions for them. "What is the company culture like?" to which they respond: "Did Derek show you our foosball table?"
   
   My question is what are the ways to ask this question without actually asking it? No one will respond to a direct inquiry saying: "Culture? Our culture is pretty garbage. You actually probably don't want to work here at all, if I'm honest..." I've yet to find a good way to ask this question and wondering if you have any suggestions here. Love the show - keep up the good work!


2. I have been lucky to have leadership opportunities in the past where I was responsible for the career growth, engagement, mentoring of a handful of team members.  I recently started a new job where I am outranked by a recently promoted employee who is brilliant, but lacks some leadership qualities.  To make things more awkward, this person does not take feedback well.  However, I think I may be able to provide some feedback to help this person grow as a leader.  Have you ever been in a similar situation?  How would you approach this?
