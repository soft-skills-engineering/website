In episode 2, Jamison and Dave answer two questions:



1. I work on a team, and I am not the team lead. I have lots of ideas for how to do things better. How can I influence my team without being the team lead, or without stepping on his or her shoes?



2. How do you deal with anger at work, both on the receiving and giving end?
