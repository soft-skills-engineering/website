In episode 26, Jamison and  Dave answer these question:

## How do you make sure people know about your good work?

See [Matt Zabriskie's](https://twitter.com/mzabriskie) [great post](http://www.mattzabriskie.com/blog/communicate-your-efforts) for background on this.

We also mentioned [Do Things, Write About It](http://mdswanson.com/blog/2013/08/11/write-things-tell-people.html).



## How do you get your point across effectively so you don't have to say "I told you so" later?
