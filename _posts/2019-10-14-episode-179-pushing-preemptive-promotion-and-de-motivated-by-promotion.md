In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hello! I love listening to your show. I often relisten to old episodes. I'm a Front End Developer at an IT consulting company. I will be reaching my 1 year anniversary at the company in March (it's September right now). How do I talk to my manager about a promotion? I would like to become a Sr front end Developer. I have never had to have this conversation because I have always changed jobs before reaching 1 year with the company. I need help on how to start the conversation. Thank you!


2. A member of my team asked for a promotion; we discussed and it was decided that if we worked on a set of core skills we could push for the promotion in a few months time. Since this conversion they have lacked motivation and productivity has dropped. What should I do now?
