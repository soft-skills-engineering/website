In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. A listener named Jay asks,
   
   Over the past eight years I’ve been promoted from Software Dev to Team Lead and then to Engineering Manager.
   
   After two years as an EM, it helped me a lot financially, I like what I do and I think I'm doing it really well. However, I have two concerns.
   First, I love programming and now I don't have any time other than in my limited free time to do it. I can feel my coding skills atrophying.
   
   Second, I’m worried that I could only get EM jobs in the future, and there are fewer openings for EMs than for Senior Software Developers.
   
   Could I go back to a software developer role? Would they even take me?

2. I work for a staff augmentation company in an African country for a software company in New York. I've been with this client for the last five years and I have climbed up the ladder enough that I can access the company financials. I am paid based on my location, which is not much after the exchange rate to local currency. My pay hasn’t increased as I’ve become more effective. Since seeing that info, I don't feel the need to go over and beyond for this client anymore. The client expects me to be a rockstar developer and ship out code faster they can think of more ways to make money but my enthusiasm has diminished over time and my manager has been notified about it. What steps would you take to ensure you get reasonable pay as a dev earning a location based pay? The staff augmentation company is ran by US citizens.
