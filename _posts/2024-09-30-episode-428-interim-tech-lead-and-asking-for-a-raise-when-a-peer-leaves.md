In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Listener Muszyn asks,
   
   I have been working as a SWE for almost two years. My team lead was recently fired leaving me as the most senior junior developer on the team of 4. I was given the option to be the interim team lead until we are able to fill the now open role. I was always indifferent on whether I would go the technical or managerial route in the future so this could be a really cool opportunity. On the other hand I could be setting myself up for failure in the future if my SWE skills diminish if the hunt for a new lead takes too long. Should I accept this opportunity knowing I won't get the chance to gain this experience for quite some time, or continue to hone my engineering skills just to end up in meeting marathons in my later years?
   
   note: Team leads here are more like resource managers that interface with PMs/TPMs than engineers that happen to have direct reports.

2. How do I demand a raise when a peer leaves?
   
   I'm one of two tech leads on a larger team (structured as two teams, each with a team of 4 devs of various levels plus 1 lead, but we all pretty much work as one large team).  The company is a sinking ship and I have been half-actively interviewing but not having a ton of success; and for some personal reasons there's an advantage to staying where I am vs. leaving right now.  But this peer leaving means my workload is going to increase substantially.
   
   I might try talking to my manager and demanding a raise, but I've never really played this game before.  What tips and tricks should I know to make the conversation go as favorably as possible?
   
   difficulty:  The reason everybody is unhappy is because of budget cuts and hiring freezes to begin with, so the company probably sees this as an opportunity to save money by not backfilling this person.  I don't know if that's good for me (even a hypothetical 50% raise for me would have the company ""saving"" the other 50%) or bad for me (the company will be less amenable to giving me the raise and will probably be happy to drive me away and ""save"" even more).
