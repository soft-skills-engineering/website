In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. “Hello,
   Is it considered ok to be a bit funny during an interview?
   To give more context:
   In a recent interview, I progressed up to the final cultural-fit round after clearing all technical rounds at a well-known company.
   One of my interviewer asked how I would deal with conflicts with a peer. In a effort to lighten the mood, I jokingly said I would snitch on them to my manager. I saw the faces go pale on the zoom call. So I backed-up and explained I was just joking and gave them an example of an instance where I had to deal with a conflict. The story didn't help much to make my case, as there was some "snitching" involved in it.
   But in all seriousness, if I had a conflict in the past and have reached out to my manager to help diffuse the conflict, is it considered a bad thing. How do I make it sound like a good thing during culture-fit interviews?
   By the way I didn't get an offer from them. Can't help but think I goofed-up the culture interview.
   Thanks for your time and help.”

2. I recently started my first full-time job out of college. I earned an engineering degree but took a job with a company in a more management/ business development/ leadership track. Now I’m the only person in a department with an engineering degree.I'll be here for a couple of years before they move me into the next role in my track.
   
   In a casual conversation about going back to school, one of my coworkers jokingly mentioned they would get free school at a local university because they made less than X dollars. This threw me off, as I (having started less than 3 weeks ago), make more than X dollars despite us having the same position and them having worked in the department for almost a year.
   
   Should I say anything, or just assume that the difference in pay is due to the fact that I have a technical degree and am on a leadership track while they are in neither? I've been told it's mutually beneficial to discuss salary with your coworkers, but I'm afraid to shake things up at my very traditionally run company in my first month here. My pay corresponds directly to the starting pay that an engineer in a design role in my company would be making and I think I was given this pay so not to discourage me from taking a role in the company in favor of an engineering job with engineering pay elsewhere.
