In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hi guys! I was faced with quite a dilemma recently.
   
   A few days ago one of my co-workers said he was sick and worked from home. But the next day he came to office, constantly sneezing and looking terrible, and for some reason finished the day in the office. The same happened the day after that. I didn't want to be rude and I felt for this guy, but I didn't want to get sick either cause I have some important tasks this week.
   
   What could have I done? I could not just tell him "go home you fool, you're contagious!" I could say "Hey! I noticed you're not feeling very well, why don't you come to the manager and ask to work from home this week?" But I didn't have the guts to do this. Besides, what if he couldn't work from home for some reason?
   
   I solved this by lying to my manager that I'm ill too, and worked from home. What is the best solution here?


2. Hi, I recently went through my company's annual review process. The review went pretty much as expected, with things that I was doing well and things that I could improve on. However, I received some negative feedback which I disagreed with. I asked for additional detail and examples of this, but neither my manager, or his manager (our site lead) could give me any concrete examples.
   
   After some further discussion they agreed to remove the comment from my review, but I'm now left wondering why this feedback was added in the first place if there were no examples they could give me. Their explanation for this was that it was feedback for our team, am I wrong or is an annual performance review the wrong place for that kind of feedback?
   
   Should I be concerned that they actually do have feedback for me, but were unwilling to do so given my reaction?
   Is this enough of a red flag to maybe consider looking for a new job?
