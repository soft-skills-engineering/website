In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I am working at my first job as a software engineer for 2 1/2 years now. I really enjoy working as a programmer and I'm super excited about the tech industry in general.
   
   However, sometimes I feel like I'm too excited about everything. I spent a lot of time reading blog posts, watching tutorials or taking online courses. I think about what books to read and what languages to learn all the time. Not everything but a big part of it happens during my working hours. While I know that "loving to learn" in general is considered a positive trait, I feel like I might take it a bit too far and I should focus more on the actual tasks I have - especially, because I think my coworkers spend much less time keeping up to date with everything.
   
   What is a reasonable amount of time to spent on these things during working hours and beyond? How do I know I spend too much time not working on my actual tasks? How can I make sure I learn the right things that are useful to my career?
   
   Love the show and wish you the best. Thanks for your advice!

2. I landed a new job that nearly tripled my salary realative to the job I'm about to leave (yes, I was horribly underpaid)!  The stories and tips from this podcast really helped me out but I also landed this job through Hired.com (the podcast sponsor).
   
   Any good tips regarding leaving a job when you know your boss will be furious that you're leaving? Also, should I tell my boss which company I'm going to when he asks (he definitely will)?
