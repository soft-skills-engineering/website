This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. A developer on a team I lead doesn't seem interested in growing. How do I help them engage more?
2. I gave two weeks notice, but was told part of the way through to not come in any more. I still had work left and this made me feel bad. Is this common? Did I do anything wrong?


Jamison talks about the [Khan Academy](http://engineering.khanacademy.org/posts/career-development.htm) engineering culture. He kinda misquoted it though. They don't explicitly say they lay people off who don't progress.
