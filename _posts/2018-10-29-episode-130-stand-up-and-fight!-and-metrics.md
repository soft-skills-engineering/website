This is a rerun of episode 87 from December 14, 2017.

In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. 'I've been working on a project for the past year with two other senior developers. One of them is the lead, and the other, is my peer. We all have a lot of respect for each others opinions and resolve our engineering disputes amicably.
   
   My problem is that sometimes my peer will just give up saying ""have it your way"" etc. I want to have it out with him and evaluate each solution on its merits. I've considered saying ""STAND AND FIGHT YOU MANGY CUR"", but then looked up ""Mangy Cur"" and decided against it.
   
   How do i get him to be more vocal about his opinions? (so that i can prove to him that i'm right)


2. I like the idea of measuring things, but I also feel like work "metrics" are easy to game and hard to make indicative of actual quality work being done / product being produced.
   
   In particular I worry when the data collected leads people to choose work that will bump stats rather than lead to better end user experiences / product / maintainable code. What kind of data do you think is useful to collect in terms of developer activity? Can you share some examples of ways you've been able to assess your own and your coworkers productivity?
   
   I'm interested in this both on a team level and a personal one. How can I get better if I don't have a way to track what "good" is for myself? Is trying to turn the complicated and messy thing that is what I actually do all day into a trackable, data driven domain a fool's errand?
