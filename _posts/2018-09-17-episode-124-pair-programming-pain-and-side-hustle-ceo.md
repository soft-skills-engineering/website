In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I joined a new team that has a different way of working, which has exposed a lot of my shortcomings.
   
   On my previous team, collaboration was limited to discussions around architecture and strategy; after reaching consensus, we'd implement the components independently. I was very comfortable with this because I don't have good intuition for how to interact with others.
   
   On the new team, we pair-program. Teammates have pointed out mistakes I've made while pairing, such as trying to control the mouse when they are in the middle of doing something or investigating something on my own computer without communicating what I'm doing. On this team, we are also expected to be much more engaged in group decision-making. As a result, I've made tons of mistakes in how or when I pose questions. Each time I make a mistake, it increases my self-loathing. I tried telling myself that I didn't have bad intent when I made the mistake and the only way to grow is to make mistakes. I also told myself that this self-loathing doesn't do anything for the team. I also do a personal post-mortem on each of my mistakes because I thought that would help me move on. These approaches didn't work and my confidence has dropped substantially. I know it's essential for me to learn how to work effectively with others instead of staying in my comfort zone of heads-down coding. Do you have suggestions for how to get through this learning process without letting it affect my self esteem and motivation?


2. Hey Soft Skills Engineering,
   
   Love the podcast! You’ve helped me understand so much about the software engineering career field that I probably would have otherwise learned the hard way.
   
   I’ve been working at my current job for almost 4 years. The pay is very much below market (it’s a non-profit), the work is too easy, I can finish any task in a couple of hours, but we are given an automatic 1 week+ deadline to finish anything, and I’m much more technical than any of my co-workers, to the point where I can’t even have nerdy conversations with anyone at work.
   
   However, I’ve stuck around because the job is pretty much stress-free, I don’t have to think about work at all outside of work hours, and all the free time allows me to take on side-projects and learn new technologies, including every level of software development.
   
   With all this free time, I’ve started a company. In the last few months, I’ve managed developers, designed a system using blockchain tech, designed and implemented a database, learned the ins and outs of AWS management and server-less development, built a REST API from scratch, developed a full front-end in React/Redux, and learned a ton of other things.
   
   Since I’m in the prototype phase, my startup hasn’t gotten any revenue, and I’m aware it might take awhile to get any revenue if it ever does. I need to pay bills, and I need to start thinking about my financial stability. So I think it’s time to get a new job, even if it means not having as much freedom to work on the startup.
   
   I’m not sure on how to approach my next step. I want to continue working on the startup after I get a new job, but I’m aware that employers might not be fond of “CEO” on my resume when there’s no end-date on the position, because I might leave at any time if my company grows. If I don’t put anything about my company on my resume, then it seems like I have nothing to show for all the technical skills I claim I have (since all the learning, management and implementation has all been for my company).
   
   Do I put anything about the startup I’m working on in my resume? If not, then how would I showcase all the experience and skills I’ve gained by beginning this startup? Should I just keep getting by paycheck to paycheck while I build the company?
   
   Thanks
