It's a special ng-conf live episode! [Dave](https://twitter.com/djsmith42) and [Jamison](https://twitter.com/jamison_dance) answer these questions in front of a live audience:

1. When you go freelancing, do your coding skills atrophy?
2. What is something you wish you knew about freelancing before you started?
3. I met all my aggressive career goals. What next?

Here is the [Khan Academy Engineering Ladder](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qr0d05X5-AsyDYqKRCfgGGcWSshTMd_vfTggfhDpbls/edit) Jamison mentioned towards the end of the show.
