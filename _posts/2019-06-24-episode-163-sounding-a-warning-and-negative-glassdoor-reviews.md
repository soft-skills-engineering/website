In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I recently joined a new team to help rewrite a batch job whose source code has long been lost. After taking some time to learn the tech stack and the business problem, I realized that the current approach will not let us meet our nightly deadline. Even a very generous back of the envelope estimate suggests that we’ll miss it by two orders of magnitude. I have some ideas on how to maybe fix this... buuuttt...
   
   I brought my concerns and calculations to the lead project engineer who dismissed them outright. They did not offer an explanation for why I was wrong, even when I asked for one. I started a proof of concept to illustrate my point, but there were some weird conversations that suggested that I should just drop the issue.
   
   I know how to make a technical argument about my concerns, but apparently that isn’t enough.
   
   How can I get fellow engineers to at least take my concerns seriously, not just for this project, but generally? I’m only 3.5 years into my career, so is it just a seniority thing?


2. Hi! I'm a software engineer and I'm currently looking for my next job. It will be my second-ever job, so this means this will be my first time putting the Soft Skill Engineering advice (""quit your job"") in practice. Woo-hoo!
   Anyway... Browsing the job offerings I often check Glassdoor to see what people are saying about the given company, and I found a lot of negative reviews. I imagine sites like Glassdoor are negatively-biased, but these reviews left me wondering if there is any way I can investigate how good or bad working for the company would be. Maybe through some questions during the interviews? Any idea?
   By the way, I love the show, keep up the great work!
