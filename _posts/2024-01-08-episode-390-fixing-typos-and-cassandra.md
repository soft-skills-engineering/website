In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I’m a backend engineer at a large non-public company. I noticed a bunch of our emails and website riddled with typos. I can not claim that it is metrics impacting or impacting business, so I get that teams always deprioritize, but the overall feel just irks me. Many of these come from a CMS I don’t have access too, so it’s not like I could offer to help with code even if I wanted. When things like this are not in your space, any advice on how to up overall quality?

2. Possibly Mute Senior Engineer asks,
   
   I'm currently a senior engineer in a really small startup, and I've been here just long enough that I'm deeply familiar with our flagship product in multiple areas - infrastructure, the guts of the business logic, our deployment patterns, our most common failure modes, etc. Unfortunately, I have to be involved in every project and pick the application up off the ground when it dies. As a result, I've become spread very thin, and I have to cut corners just to stay afloat (or I am specifically directed to cut corners to meet a deadline). Frequently (because of all the corner cutting), we run into two situations that really tick me off:
   
   - I see bad thing on the horizon, talk to my team about it, am ignored, then bad thing happens and I get to have a crappy day fixing it
   - I recommend a basic best practice, we don't use it and do some coat hanger + duct tape thing instead, thing breaks, and I get to have a crappy day fixing it.
   
   I'm very tired of being on the wrong end of the consequences of our own actions. I pour so much into this job, but I feel like I need to go get my vocal cords inspected, because it's like my teammates and my manager can't hear me when I talk about the things we're doing poorly that lead to bad outcomes.
   
   Quit my job? Or is there an easy way to deal with this situation that I'm just missing? I feel like I'm screaming into the void every time I have these discussions and get completely blown off with "oh that's not important right now" or "oh that terrible thing could never happen". Thanks in advance!
