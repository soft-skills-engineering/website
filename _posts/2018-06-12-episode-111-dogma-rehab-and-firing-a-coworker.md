In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hello Jamison and Dave. üíï your show! üëè

   I have been a C# dev for 7 years. Last year, I learn Erlang. I fell in love with functional programming. After that I learned Elm and oh boy... I had never dreamed a compiler/computer could do so much work for me, preventing so many mistakes that would otherwise require an unholy number of "unit tests".

   The thing is I can no longer find satisfaction with any job. I love to write software, but at some point I became almost dogmatic. I abhor more and more the discipline it takes, in certain languages, to make my code be as pure and testable as in an FP language.

   I had to do so much un-learning, that now I feel that I am refusing to un-un-learn all these different ideas and paradigms and just go back to making the tests happy.

   I seek your humorous words of wisdom on how to find contentment with my job again, without looking at a language and dreading it.

2. I have a co-worker, who is pretty incompetent technically. Over the past few years that I've been here, he has proved time and again that he is incapable of learning and really grasping how things work. He is able to accomplish basic feature work, but not capable of making good architecture decisions, or why a given framework should be chosen, or how to solve harder problems (I‚Äôm not sure how to describe this. But for example, how to build a resilient API client).

   However this person is great at creating slides, and presentations, and JIRAs, so I think management thinks they are ok at their job. 

   He‚Äôs also a nice guy. I‚Äôm not sure how to say, hey you suck at your job. Which is pretty harsh. Or to suggest to someone that he should be replaced.
