In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. My (very large) company has an alternative definition of “unit testing”. Unit testing at this company refers to when a developer manually tests their code in whatever interface the code is associated with after they write it. An example usage would be a standup status update such as “I finished writing the code for ticket x I am just doing unit testing to make sure my code works”. My concern is that there is very little real unit testing at this company and the I think the misuse of this term makes it harder for real unit testing to become more prevalent. Is this worth speaking up about?


2. Feeling Isolated and demotivated while working from home.
   With COVID 19 pandemic we have been working from for more than six months and looks like it will be another six months at least before we get back to work.
   We are already a geographically distributed team and with work from home the interactions within team have become harder. We do have once week team meeting but there are more than 20 people and it is usually a tech talk.
   Sometimes I go days without interacting with the team outside of slack/email. I have realized this tends to make me more distracted or demotivated.
   Interacting with team members and seniors within team gives big picture information, ongoing projects etc. that helps keep me motivated.
   I have tried proposing virtual happy hours or even meetings within small groups who working closely once a week or so. Understandably not everyone is enthused about virtual happy hours. Do you guys have any other suggestions?
