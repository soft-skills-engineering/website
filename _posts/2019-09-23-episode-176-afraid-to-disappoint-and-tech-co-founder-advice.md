In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I am a junior developer with a low salary but I'm happy with my job.
   
   Recently, a personal/family problem occurred I needed more money to pay for it. I am three months away from my EOC (end of contract).
   
   I've found a job referral from my dear friend with higher salary and more benefits and I'm planning to apply. But after told my manager about my plans on leaving they told me they wanted to assign me to a top priority project they thought I could handle. I am so worried to disappoint them.
   
   They're offering a raise but it's not close to the other job. I'm afraid to ask for more because I don't feel confident with my skills and I believe other people deserving it more. What are your thoughts?


2. Hi guys,  I am starting up a company in a few weeks together with a friend of mine. I'll be the only developer in our new firm (for now!), while he's got the domain knowledge. I'm not so worried about getting the tech stuff up and running. I get no constraints when it comes to the tech stack I choose, which is fantastic!
   
   What worries me is how to get into this brand new domain as quickly as possible, so I am able to deliver some value (MVP). Do  you have any tips for how to go about this? I know I am not going to be an expert in the field, so at some point I just have to accept that and start coding. Anyways, I'll learn more on the way..
   
   Thanks for a great show btw,
   Regards from Runar in Norway
