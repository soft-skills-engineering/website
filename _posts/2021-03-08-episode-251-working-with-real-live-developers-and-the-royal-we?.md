In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

## Questions

1. I'm not a developer, and have never worked with developers. I have four years of systems/IT experience (ansible, bash, python, windows, etc). I got hired in a devops role at a company with many developers.
   How can I make sure I'll have meaningful discussions (and a good learing experience) with software developers in my upcoming devops role at a new company?
   Will they notice that I don't know what an enterprise communication bus is if just don't ask but instead scribble something in my notebook?


2. I just watched "How to crash an airplane" by Nickolas Means. It is about how the flight crew of an airplane crashed in 1989 yet saved 189 lives. The learning is that there are no heroes and teams can succeed only with inputs from all members in the team. All opinions need to be heard. And he also emphasizes that the captain used "we" in all his speeches.
   
   When it comes to interviews, the expectation is to talk about your personal experience. Using "we" during interviews would look like negative, right? Especially in leadership interviews, this is difficult since leaders are successful only with their team.
   
   Can you give us some strategies to balance this the best?
