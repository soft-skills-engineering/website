Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. When I let someone go, should I tell them the reason why?
2. How do I write a good job description?

We mention Julia Evans' blog post [A litmus test for job descriptions](https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/10/21/a-litmus-test-for-job-descriptions/) in the second question.
