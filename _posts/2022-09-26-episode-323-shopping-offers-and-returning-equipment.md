In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I'm planning to leave my job purely because of low compensation. I like my growth in my current company - but low compensation than what market is offering is quite a mental hiccup in my regular work (yep! I'm slowly becoming one of the quiet quitters). I'm thinking of going to my manager with my new offer and ask him to match it. Do retention offers actually work? As mangers yourselves, how would you want me to approach a retention discussion? I don't want my manager to make my life hell under the pretense of "Oh he'll leave in a year" if I do decide to stay after taking the matching offer.
   Love the show - pretty much my single source of wisdom for all my behavioural interviews xD

2. I was recently let go from a company. They said they would send me a shipping label so that I could return the hardware. I didn’t hear back from them for a week. A few days later a label came in for the laptop, but not for the dock or the two monitors they also sent.
   
   I did not enjoy my experience there and I'm feeling resentful at having to pester them so that I can get what I need to send them back their hardware.
   
   What is my due diligence on the score? I don't even like the monitors.
