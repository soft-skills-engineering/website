In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I went to an internal company developer meetup recently. The speaker was really new at the topic they were presenting and shared some incorrect information. I didn't want to correct the speaker in front of a bunch of people, but I also didn't want everyone at the meetup to leave with incorrect information.
   
   How can I be respectful to the speaker while making sure attendees aren't misinformed?
   
   Thanks for doing the podcast! I think it's great!


2. I recently joined a new company as a Product Manager, this is my first non-development role after 5 years of development. It took me a lot of time to get to this role. During the interview they said I would be involved in development at the beginning of my role to get to know the system and not implementing my own features. After ramping up a bit, I was able to define a bunch of features, but management kept telling me that they are finding it hard to find people and they want me to implement the features myself. I have no problem doing it for my first project but I feel this is going to continue and 6 months from now I will still be working a as developer again. I can leave and get another Dev role but I am really excited about product and I want to continue in this career transition.
