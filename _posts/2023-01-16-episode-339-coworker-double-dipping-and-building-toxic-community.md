In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I think the new hire on my team is juggling multiple jobs.
   
   On several screen shares, I've seen them quickly close IDEs with third party code, browser windows with what look like a third party jira instance, etc. Maybe that's some open source project, or a jira instance where they're reporting a bug, but it seems fishy. In the latest instance, this person meant to post a link to the Jira issue they're working on in our company Slack, but accidentally posted a link to a ticket on some other company's Jira. I did some digging and this is definitely not a public-facing Jira instance. It's internal for their employees only.
   
   Normally if somebody could do both jobs competently, I'd say good for them and they've earned both salaries. However, their performance hasn't been great. We're still in the onboarding phase and a lot of missteps could be excused by that, but I'm starting to worry that this person's goal is to offer only mediocre performance at this job (and probably the other one as well) and we're unlikely to see expected levels of improvement as they continue to get up to speed.
   
   Am I being paranoid? Should I raise my concerns with management or give it more time to shake out? Is there a clever trap I can set to \*prove\* my suspicions for sure?

2. I recently joined a large software defined telecommunication company, only to be surprised that their internal blind space is very quiet and very few ppl are on blind if any, how do I change this ? how do I get ppl to use blind more? without giving away my blind account. quitting my job is not an option due to the economy
