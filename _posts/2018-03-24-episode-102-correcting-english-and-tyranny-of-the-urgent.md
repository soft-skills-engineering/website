[Dave](https://twitter.com/djsmith42) and [Jamison](https://twitter.com/jamison_dance) answer these questions:

1. A teammate is a great developer but English isn't their first language. Sometimes this results in bad grammar or spelling mistakes in code comments, variables, and method names. Often I correct it in code review, but I sometimes feel like I'm nit-picking, although I really do want it changed to be correct. It slows down code reviews. And of course, I don't wish to appear racist or discriminatory. Any ideas for solving this?
2. This is my first job out of college. Been there for 2.5 years. It feels like my manager is always firefighting and not able to be proactive, trapped by the tyranny of the urgent. It feels like our group is always behind on deadlines trying to catch up and we've accrued large amounts of technical debt with little to no time spent on improving our processes or tools. The result is that we produce a worse product and documentation than we should. This causes additional support required down the road further loading down the group. What can I or my manager do to improve this situation? Is this more common than I think?
