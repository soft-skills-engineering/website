In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I work for a big bank. I recently found out I am severely underpaid. I have only received “exceeds expectations” ratings since joining over 5 years ago. I rage-interviewed at a bunch of FAANG companies, made it to the final rounds of all, but always came up short on the offer.
   
   Expectations at my current job are low. I’ve been putting all my extra energy and time into my own startup idea with a group of small people, that shows a lot of promise.
   
   I so desperately want to leave my current job, but I can't prep for interviews and work on my startup at the same time. I never interviewed since joining the bank over 5 years ago.
   
   I truly believe my startup can ultimately be my escape, but I’m just grappling with the fact that it may take years before I can quit vs. if I got a new job I’d have much better pay and not be depressed at my 9-5.
   
   P.S. are you hiring?

2. I've recently been placed as tech lead for a small group of 3 people, myself included. One of my teammates seems to be having a hard time communicating in a timely manner when they are stuck on something or when their task will be late.  I've spoken to that person a few times individually on the importance of communicating early and often, but it seems like that person is happy to just muddle on until the time runs out.
   
   I've had to jump on to finish some work that was time sensitive and I've gone to greater lengths to slack dm on how things are going. It's getting old. I don't want to be micro managing.  Each time I bring it up with them, it seems to get through but never manifests in action. I'm not sure if this person realizes the impact that lack of communication has especially in a remote first setting.  A sense of urgency might be helpful in some respects.
   
   At one of our 1on1 dm chats the topic of imposter syndrome came up and we shared our mutual struggles with it.  I've tried to encourage that person that my dm's are open and can help but I can't keep checking in.  There should be some ownership on their end to getting help from me.  How do I get this person to communicate more, share blockers or confusion so we can finish our work on time and learn on the way?
   
   Love your show, long time listener, first time caller.
