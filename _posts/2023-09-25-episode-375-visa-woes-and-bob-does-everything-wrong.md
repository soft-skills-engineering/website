In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I work as a Software Engineering Manager at the European office of a US company. Recently, many of my colleagues successfully obtained US visas for an upcoming business trip. When it was my turn, everyone said it would be a piece of cake because our company is well-known. However, to my surprise, I was rejected during the visa interview. Now I won't be able to join my colleagues (including my direct reports). I'm concerned they might perceive me as less capable because of this. What would you think if your manager couldn't travel with you? To make matters worse, I might soon be managing a few US-based employees remotely.

2. Hi guys, love the podcast. I never miss an episode!
   
   I have a co-worker, let's call him "Bob". Bob's a lovely guy and very eager to learn.
   
   Here's the thing. Bob never learns from his mistakes and needs to be continually asked to correct the same types of errors over and over again.
   
   The problem is that Bob doesn't seem to have a developers mindset. I'd go so far as to say that if there's a decision to be made then Bob is 95% guaranteed to do the opposite of what everybody else on the team would do.
   
   The end result of this is that whenever a pull request is opened up with Bobs name attached to it I can be sure that I will be spending more time reviewing it and inevitably the PR will need to go back and forth multiple times as Bob is asked to correct the same types of things that he was just asked to correct in the last review.
   
   The frustrating is that my manager is also nice and wants to encourage Bob to grow and improve and so regularly gives Bob some pretty complex tasks in order to encourage this growth. While I admire the managers attitude (and surely have benefitted from it on occasions :) ) my heart sinks just a bit more than normal when this happens as I know that the previously mentioned merry go round of reviews will inevitably be larger than usual. Sometimes it can get to the point where much (or all) of Bobs work ends up being discarded.
   
   I do precious little development work myself as my senior position in the team means that I'm the one ends up doing most of the peer reviewing. So each time I see Bob being given a piece of work that I would have enjoyed doing (and sometimes have even specced out) I get disheartened.
   
   Bob has been a developer in our field for about 6 years and still needs to be told on a regular basis about things that you would usually need to tell a fresh graduate.
   
   How do I broach the issue of Bob with the powers that be?
