In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. My manager smells really bad! Sometimes so bad that I can't bear to be in his proximity. I am not sure if it's his breath, or body odour (probably both), but the smell is very foul on a daily basis. He has been with us for quite a few months now, but I am not sure if anybody has mentioned it to him, because the situation hasn't gotten any better. I've also retrained from speaking about it with anyone else. He's a good guy, and a very hard worker. I want to build a better relationship with him, but his smell is literally getting in the way. How can I help this situation? I can never tell him outright, but he's the worst smelling person I've ever met, and have to work with. But I do want to work with him. Help.


2. Hey friends, thanks for such an engaging and helpful show, it makes me happy to see every new episode pop up in my feed.
   
   My question relates to the politics and drama of a restructure and whether I should follow the time honoured tradition of 'quit your job' or stick this out.
   
   Six months ago our new VP of Engineering was hired to work remotely in a city across the country and decided that the first order of business was to restructure our three Engineering teams into one mega team with new management and a matrix structrure.  This meant 15 Principals, Senior Engineers and Product Managers decided it was 'time to move on to a new challenge' and are now being replaced by the VPs ex-colleagues in the city across the country.  All our processes are being thrown away to do things 'their way', new Jira boards, new Confluence pages, new file locations, new AWS accounts, new hiring processes, new everything.  The new folks are getting the pick of the exciting and high profile projects while those of us who have been around for up to ten years and hold the institutional knowledge are left monitoring and maintaining the fragile work that could really do with some help from the Principals and Seniors.
   
   Is this all part of a standard restructure after six months?  Should I carry on trying to put on a smile and fall in line or run away as fast as I can?
