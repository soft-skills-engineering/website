In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hey guys, a long time listener here, I love the show.
   
   I've recently joined an early-stage startup with a tiny engineering team. It's like most startups at this stage, there's some chaos and a lot to figure out. It's exactly what I like about startups.
   
   In the past years, I've been working on the very same kind of software we're building now. I have a ready answer for many questions we might have, I've seen some things go badly and others work great. I'm eager to help the team deliver.
   
   But I also don't want to be seen as the know-it-all jerk that tells everyone how to do their job. I have respect for my team and want to contribute. How do I use my experience without annoying my colleagues?
   
   Thanks for sharing your wisdom (I hope for 101% of it).
