In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I'm current doing nearly nothing at work (not by choice) and getting paid a king's ransom for it, just to stay on the roster. I've never been in this situation before. Would I be foolish to give it all up just to not be miserably bored? I'm pretty sure this isn't sustainable, and I'd get laid off in the next economic downturn before you guys might get to my question, but just curious what your insights are.


2. How to deal with teams that are run as "Agile", but management who want timelines and deadlines to steer the business?
   
   I'm at my second large software development company that's following the agile/scrum ceremonies with weekly sprints that entail grooming/planning/retro meetings. Management keeps track of progress to align the efforts of multiple teams spread across the organization. I've noticed over the past year an increased desire for estimated timelines for when each team will be done with their portion of the project. This forces the team to groom and size stories months out ahead. These estimates end up becoming deadlines that need justification to be pushed back, which is common since as you get into the work you find more stories need to be added.
   
   I had a very similar experience at my last company. Both have 5-10k employees.
   
   I understand the needs of the business to plan ahead. So saying "it'll be ready when it's done" is not a good answer. However, it feels like we're constantly falling behind arbitrary deadlines and in a constant frenzy to catch up.
   
   So....what do?
