In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. I've been job hunting while employed (gasp), and I have a number of opportunities that have advanced to the in-person interview. Most of the requests I've seen have said that they'll be 4-5 hours in the office (which seems fairly typical).
   
   The problem is that I don't have unlimited vacation, and I feel dishonest taking so many days off. How can I navigate new opportunities without disrespecting them, or completely failing in my current responsibilities?


2. Hey guys, great show (though I think, as with all shows, it could probably use more discussion of badgers [yes, I said badgers!]).
   
   I’m about to start a new job (I took the time-honored and hallowed show advice, though I’m leaving on great terms with my old job) and will be coming in as that fanciest of newly-invented titles in software, Staff Software Engineer. This is the only third time I’ve started a new job [not counting odd jobs in high school and college], and I’ve never stepped into a *leadership* role before when starting. What are the most helpful things you’ve done or seen other engineers do when joining a team in a technical leadership role?
   
   Thanks!
