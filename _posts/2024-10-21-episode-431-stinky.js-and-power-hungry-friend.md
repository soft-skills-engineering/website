In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hey! Love your podcast! I‚Äôve been poached by a startup which sounds really exciting but I‚Äôm worried whether it is a good career move for me. I am currently working with backend, however this company would have more of a full stack role and it would be lots of nodeJS and Typescript ü§¢ anything javascript related screams frontend to me and it is not something I want to be good at. However, besides this, the product sounds interesting and I would definitely have a lot to learn. I also have this inferior feeling that I‚Äôm lacking skills because I didn‚Äôt study CS. Will I still be able to become a good engineer even if that‚Äôs in NodeJS? üòÅ

2. Listener Ben asks,
   
   Hiya! I'm a young developer with a broad range of experience (everything from hardware to full-stack web and mobile), and I've found myself quite useful at many startups. I just started a new position at a nice startup in my area, but I'm being recruited by one of my close friends from college. He's the power-hungry type, currently working at a mega-tech corp but wants to make a startup and get rich. He's very smart and charming, and while I am skeptical of his ability to make a great product I think he can certainly raise a bunch of investment capital without too much worry.
   
   My question is: would you ever consider joining a close friend's startup, and if so what would you need (in terms of contract/equity/salary, runway, savings) to be confident about making that commitment? Thanks!
