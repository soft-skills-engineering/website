In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hi there Dave and Jamison! I am a tech lead in a small team of 5 people. 4 of them start working at 10-11 AM and one of them likes to start working at 1-2 PM. This person is me.
   Due to my biorhythm I feel I am the most productive at this time, and I also like to do some of the non-work-related stuff in the morning.
   
   Nobody in my team has any objections but as a team lead I feel guilty because it often happens that I block someone with my work schedule. I'm trying to do as much as I can to unblock everyone - distributing tasks in the evening, making it clear everyone knows what to do - but that's not always helpful so it usually turns out that I am stopping my morning tasks to have a call and explain something or have a text conversation. Tbh it irritates me very much :D
   
   Should I feel guilty? As a tech lead, am I responsible for working at the same time everyone does?


2. Hey Dave and Jamison! I love the show, I've listened to every episode and your advice has helped me a TON!
   
   I started a new job in a different city a month ago and because of Covid-19 everyone went remote, so I didn't physically move to that city then. Now there are talks of going back to the office, and one of the developers on my team is also looking for a place to live so we started talking about rooming together.
   
   It seemed fine to me but then I realized I'd be spending almost ALL of my time with this person who I have not even met in real life yet.
   
   Do you think this is a good idea with a lot of convenience or a recipe for disaster? Have you ever lived with a co-worker? Any advice would be great.
   
   Thanks!
