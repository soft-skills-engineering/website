This week Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. How often do candidates get hired who don't match the requirements listed in a job posting? Is it a waste for me to apply to all jobs I come across even though I only have about 1/3 of what they want?
2. I've been moved to a newly formed team. I suspect the team consists of people nobody really wants to work with. What are my options in a situation like this?
