In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hi, have you ever been through a technical interview and bombed a question? I did, and it feels awful, especially when the question was easy but I couldn't focus due to time pressure and stress. Do you have any tips for dealing with interview anxiety, and get rid of the bitter feeling if the interview goes bad?
   
   Thanks!

2. A listener Dustin asks,
   
   ‌
   
   Do tech companies or recruiters dig into our individual backgrounds during the hiring process? Also is there a bias towards part-time courses vs. Full-time? To keep it short, I'm 28 and from 18-22, I was homeless and involved with specific substances. Ultimately got on my feet around the age of 23 and now I'm currently attending university, part-time while working full-time. I have noticed a bias from full-time students towards part-time and I'm wondering if this happens as well in regards to employers?
