In this episode, Dave and Jamison answer these questions:

1. Hey! I love your podcast, you have definitely helped me improve my soft skills in my career.
   
   I am a full stack web developer and I have been pretty much loving it. Web development was not my original career plan though, I graduated with a Bachelor’s in Computational Mathematics & Computer Science, and I knew I wanted to be a software dev since working with robotics in middle school. I kinda fell into Web Development from my IT work study job in college.
   
   I have been doing this for 4 years, and I am ready to transition over to applying for Software Engineering jobs. How do I get over this scary feeling of leaving my safety net? How can I encourage myself that I can make this new career transition? There will be jobs I see posted, and I just wanna go for it, but I always get scared at the thought of leaving since it’s just so intimidating, especially coding interviews and interacting with new people, new workplace, etc. What if I end up regretting my choice? Any advice is appreciated!
   
   Thanks guys! I always look forward to your episodes every week - I share your podcast with my fellow nerd friends!


2. I work at a bureaucratic company where we move fairly slow.
   Recently, I've been getting more and more frustrated with our code review process, but I'm not sure if this has to do with my quality of code.
   
   It can take weeks for one of my pull requests to actually get merged. Someone will review my work, I will make some changes, then they will come back some days later with a new truckload of very nitpicky details that they want changed.
   
   This makes me long for the days of me working at a startup where we had no code review, and no testing process, and it's making me sad.
   How do you draw the line over what is reasonable code review and what is too much?
