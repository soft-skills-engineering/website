Jamison and Dave answer these questions:

1. I'm a new team lead with a team member who is very appraisal-driven. How do I deal with them?
2. Have you ever experienced meeting-creep? What do you do about it?

Jamison mentions the 37 signals blog post on [the downsides of group chat](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d).
